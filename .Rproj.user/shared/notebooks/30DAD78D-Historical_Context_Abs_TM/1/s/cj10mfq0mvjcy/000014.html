   <td style="text-align:left;"> The paper presents a classification and analysis of the results achieved using various
tools for the estimation of level of service (LOS) of urban streets. The basic premise of urban
streets and LOS are discussed. LOS is analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Average travel
speed (ATS) on street segments is considered as the measure of effectiveness in defining LOS criteria
of an urban street using quantitative methods. The travel speed data collection procedure has been
changing over time from the traditional followed moving observer method to a distance measuring
instrument and now global positioning system is being extensively used worldwide. Classifying
urban streets into number of classes and ATSs on street segments into number of LOS categories
are essential components of LOS analysis. Emphasis is put on application of soft computing techniques
such as fuzzy set theory, genetic algorithm, neural network, cluster analysis and modeling
and simulation for the LOS analysis of urban streets both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Quality of service of urban streets is analyzed using the satisfaction level that the road user perceived
while using the urban road infrastructure. Possibilities are shown regarding the further improvement
in research methodology. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Municipalities play an important role in the planning and
development of communities that support active transportation
(AT), which refers to human-powered modes of travel, such as
walking and cycling. Municipal-level stakeholders involved in landuse
and transportation infrastructure planning consider multiple
social, environmental and economic considerations to inform
decision-making and investments in AT. Evidence around the
fiscal benefits of AT investment for local governments has not
been systematically identified. This scoping review sought to
explore the existing evidence regarding investments in AT and
opportunities for savings on municipal expenditures and revenue
generation. In total, 7060 records were located and screened; of
which 162 full-text articles were reviewed. Ultimately, 23 articles
met our inclusion criteria and were included in this review. The
available evidence focuses on potential economic benefits of AT
in the areas of tax revenues, property values, consumer spending
and employment, all of which are relevant sources of revenue
generation in municipal operating budgets. An evidence gap was
identified regarding AT infrastructure investments and benefits
corresponding to municipal expenditures (e.g. maintenance cost
savings). Notably, a large portion of literature was published after
2009, suggesting that municipal-level evidence on the fiscal
benefits of AT investments may just be emerging. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A tool for measuring the “completeness” of a complete street has applications in developing policy, prioritising areas for infrastructure investment for a network, and solving the right-of-way allocation problem for individual streets. A literature review was conducted on the state-of-art in the assessment complete street designs. Complete streets assessment requires a context-sensitive approach, thus context-sensitive standards of “completeness” must first be established by combining a street classification system with sets of priorities and target performance levels for the different types of streets. Performance standards should address a street’s fulfilment of the movement, environmental, and place functions, and be flexible enough to account for the many ways that these functions of a street can be fulfilled. Most frameworks reviewed are unsuitable for evaluating complete streets because, with few exceptions, they guide street design by specifying the design elements for inclusion on the street. Secondly, the performance of a street can be assessed according to transportation, environmental, and place criteria, and compared to the target performance levels specified by the street’s classification. As there are many different impacts to consider on a street, additional work is required to define the priorities and performance objectives for different types of streets. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Marie Geraldine Herrmann-Lunecke, Rodrigo Mora &amp; Lake Sagaris </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2020 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> An extensive body of work from the urban planning, health, and
other disciplines has documented the importance of walking to
urban sustainability from health, safety, security, environmental
and other perspectives. These studies come mainly from countries
in North America and Europe, where the majority of the
population relies on cars for transportation. Notwithstanding, in
many countries in the Global South, walking remains a majority
transport mode, while cars increasingly dominate the urban
streetscape, but are accessible only to a minority of the
population. Chile provides fertile terrain for studying this
phenomenon. This article reviews current practice and recent
research of walking in Chile, in light of international findings
regarding walkability, equity and urban sustainability. To elaborate
an overview of the depth and breadth of walking in Chile, an
interdisciplinary team conducted a literature review, examined
relevant case study material from experience from Chile and in
particular from Santiago, and triangulated this mainly qualitative
data with results from the origin-destination survey applied in
Chile’s main cities, Chilean traffic safety data) and results from
official transport reports of other Latin American cities [Tirachini,
A. (2019). South America: The challenge of transition. In J. Stanley
&amp; D. Hensher (Eds.), A research agenda for transport policy.
Northampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing]. Findings show that
despite priority public investments that have largely prioritised
infrastructure for cars, walking in Chile has remained as the
majority transport mode up until today, especially for lowermiddle
income groups, and particularly for care-related tasks
performed mainly by women. In this sense, walking in Chile has
proven remarkably persistent. The importance of walking as the
main transport mode, against the odds, reflects economic,
cultural, and urban form determinants, which are explored in this
article. Furthermore, a recent upsurge in public interest and
community design initiatives to improve walking, particularly the
generation of a Chilean approach to “complete streets” has
emerged, opening up opportunities to challenge Chile’s version of
automobility in favour of more equitable, active and public
transportation modes. There is, therefore, in Chile an opportunity
to prioritise the walking mode, improve infrastructure for walkers
and build from preserving current high pedestrian modal shares, rather than having to reverse widespread car use, as occurs in many
countries in Europe and North America. This potential is highly
relevant as these conditions are similar to those in other Latin
American cities and, potentially, other cities elsewhere in the
Global South. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Transport and infrastructure development enables economic and social development,
but is often detrimental to sustainable development due to congestion, accidents, air pollution, as
well as greenhouse gas emissions. Various policy frameworks have been created to connect transport
with development, development with climate change and climate change mitigation with the transport
sector. However, so far no consistent framework exists that addresses these three areas in an integrated
manner.This article demonstrates that sustainable development of the transport sector is not
viable on the longer term in the absence of such a three-way framework. First, current perspectives
and practices on transport and (sustainable) development are reviewed, demonstrating that outcomes
and policies are not consistently positive on all three dimensions. The article then re-evaluates the
Avoid–Shift–Improve (ASI) approach, initially developed to address climate change mitigation
and other environmental issues in the transport sector, adding two perspectives on sustainable development
that are not generally taken into account when discussing ASI: transition theory and sustainable
lifestyles. Together with attention to the development function of transport by
incorporating Access into ASI, this could enable a more long-term sustainability-oriented view on
transport, development and climate mitigation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Active transportation modes–walk and bicycle–are central for low carbon transport, healthy
living, and complete streets initiative. Building a community with amenable walk and bicycle
facilities asks for smart planning and investments. It is critical to investigate the impact of infrastructure
building or expansion on the overall walk and bicycle mode usage prior to making
investment choices utilizing public tax money. This research developed a high performance
agent-based model to support investment decisions that allows to assess the impact of changes in
walk-bike infrastructures at a fine spatial resolution (e.g., block group level). We built the agentbased
model (ABM) in Repast-HPC platform and calibrated the model using Simultaneous
Perturbation Stochastic Simulation (SPSA) technique. The ABM utilizes data from a synthetic
population simulator that generates agents with corresponding socio-demographic characteristics,
and integrates facility attributes regarding walking and bicycling such as sidewalk width
and total length bike lane into the mode choice decision making process. Moreover, the ABM
accounts for the effect of social interactions among agents who share identical home and work
geographic locations. Finally, GIS-based maps are developed at block group resolution that allows
examining the effect of walk-bike infrastructure related investments. The results from New
York City case study indicate that infrastructure investments such as widening sidewalk and
increasing bike lane network can positively influence the active transportation mode choices.
Also, the impact varies with geographic locations–different boroughs of New York City will have
different impacts. Our ABM simulation results also indicate that social promotions foucsing on
active transportation can positively reinforce the impacts of infrastructure changes. </td>

We employ this DIDMP because commonly employed least-squares-regression techniques may fail to fully account for selection effects.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The California Complete Streets Act of 2008 requires local governments to update general
plans so that new construction or modification of roadways considers all transportation
modes, which include but are not limited to walking, cycling, and driving. This work evaluates
the effect of a complete street retrofit on Ocean Park Boulevard (hereafter referred to
as ‘‘the retrofit’’) in Santa Monica, California, in terms of the street use by different transportation
modes and corresponding ultrafine particle (UFP) and fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations.
After subtracting background concentrations, UFP decreased after the
retrofit by 4200 particles cm 3 while PM2.5 had no statistically significant change. The
emission-weighted traffic volume, an index used to account for flows of vehicles with different
pollutant-emitting capacities, decreased 26%, which may explain why UFP reductions
were observed while total traffic flow remained the same. The number of
pedestrians increased by 37% compared to pre-retrofit conditions and the number of
cyclists remained approximately the same. Although no causality could be reached, this
study observed improved air quality on street after retrofit. Nonetheless, a full evaluation
of the health impacts of the retrofit requires further information about how travel behavior,
not just traffic, has changed. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Although the causes of asthma are inconclusive, it is fairly known that exposure to outdoor air pollutants can
cause asthma, especially children's asthma morbidity. Whereas transportation is one of the major sectors that
generate air pollutants, previous research that investigates the correlation between transportation and asthma
narrowly focuses on the contribution of automobile traffic to children's asthma. Developing three spatial regression
models (a spatial lag (SL) model, a spatial error (SE) model, and a general spatial (SAC) model), this
paper investigates the roles of a variety of transportation factors in two distinct stages of children's asthma
morbidity; asthma and severe asthma. With consideration to asthma-related socio-economic factors in the City of
Seoul, the SE (R2=0.31) and SAC (R2=0.34) models consistently indicate that three out of four transportation
factors associate with children's severe asthma at statistically significant level. They include the negative influence
of bus transit and dense intersections, and the positive influence of active transportation activities on
children's asthma severity. Interestingly, however, no significant contribution of transportation factors to children's
asthma morbidity was identified by the SE (R2=0.29) and SAC (R2=0.28) models. Shedding more light
on the complexity of children's asthma morbidity and severity, this paper proposes collaborative partnerships
not only among multi- dimensional agencies, but also among multi-level government organizations. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In order to increase the sustainability of transportation in cities, streets must provide infrastructures
that favor active and public transportation modes. However, the current decisionmaking
processes in transportation projects do not always explicitly take into account sustainable
transportation requirements and often ignore concerns that may arise in other fields such as
environmental protection, health, or urban design. The proposed framework in this paper aims at
integrating sustainability in a decision-making process by creating better collaboration and
communication between professionals of such disparate fields. The framework is based on group
workshops, problem structuring, multi-criteria decision aiding and geographic information systems.
It was applied in Quebec City, Canada. The objective of the workshops was to identify
higher priority streets that should be redesigned as Complete Streets, a popular movement that
advocates “streets for everyone” in North America. To facilitate communication and use for future
decisions, the results of the analysis were integrated and presented in a geographic information
system. As a result, this user-friendly tool is currently used to support decision-making
by Quebec City officials who must choose the streets to be redesigned as Complete Streets while
ensuring transparency and traceability. Such an approach may better support policies to make
the transport system more sustainable by integrating various considerations, being transparent
and improving communication of the outcome. </td>

physical activity data from pre- and post-intervention periods, this study examines
the impact of bus rapid transit (BRT) and Complete Street implementation on walking
and cycling levels of catchment area residents in Mexico City. Propensity score matching is
applied to control for sociodemographics when evaluating intervention effects on walking
for transport, walking for recreation, and cycling for transport. On average, individuals living
in post-intervention conditions tend to achieve 29 min more of walking for transport
per week. However, the intervention effect on cycling for transport is insignificant. Using
clustering techniques, intervention effects are evaluated across different sociodemographic
groups. Women with low education experience the greatest increases in walking for transport.
Sociodemographic clusters characterized by higher education experience improvements
in recreational walking. Overall, BRT implementation and streetscape
improvements enhance physical activity, specifically walking; and the impact of these
interventions vary across different sociodemographic subgroups. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Two trends in the United States— growth in bicycling and enthusiasm for complete
streets — suggest a need to understand how various roadway users view roadway designs
meant to accommodate multiple modes. While many studies have examined bicyclists’
roadway design preferences, there has been little investigation into the opinions of
non-bicyclists who might bicycle in the future. Additionally, little research has explored
the preferences of the motorists who share roads with cyclists — despite the fact that
motorists compose the vast majority of roadway users in the United States and similarly
developed countries.
This paper presents results from an internet survey examining perceived comfort while
driving and bicycling on various roadways among 265 non-bicycling drivers, bicycling
drivers, and non-driving bicyclists in the San Francisco Bay Area. Analysis of variance tests
revealed that both drivers and bicyclists are more comfortable on roadways with separated
bicycling facilities than those with shared space. In particular, roadways with barrier separated
bicycle lanes were the most popular among all groups, regardless of bicycling
frequency. Striped bicycle lanes, a common treatment in the United States, received mixed
reviews: a majority of the sample believed that they benefit cyclists and drivers through
predictability and legitimacy on the roadway, but the lanes were rated significantly less
comfortable than barrier-separated treatments — particularly among potential bicyclists.
These findings corroborate research on bicyclists’ preferences for roadway design and
contribute a new understanding of motorists’ preferences. They also support the U.S.
Federal Highway Administration’s efforts to encourage greater accommodation of
bicyclists on urban streets. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A limited number of studies have addressed residential self-selection when considering
the relationship between the built environment (BE) and physical activity. Ignoring
self-selection may bias the estimate of the strength of the relationship and misinform
public policy. Using 2011 data from the Twin Cities, this study employs cross-sectional
and quasi-longitudinal analyses to disentangle the impacts between self-selection
(through residential preferences and travel attitudes) and neighborhood characteristics
on active travel (AT). The two approaches produce somewhat different outcomes:
attitudinal factors are extensively present in the cross-sectional analysis and the
associations between neighborhood characteristics and AT are greatly attenuated after
controlling for attitudinal factors. In contrast, neighborhood characteristics play a
dominant role in the quasi-longitudinal analysis, while attitudinal and demographic
characteristics carry additional impacts on AT. Overall, both preferences and attitudes
help explain the difference in AT. I find that while physical activity infrastructure
impacts biking, physical activity infrastructure together with transit and accessibility
affects walking, even after controlling for demographic and attitudinal characteristics.
The results highlight the importance of shaping the BE in order to provide an
infrastructure of alternative modes of transport and access to different land uses in
policy efforts to increase AT </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Although the term “sustainability” did not gain traction until the
1980s, concerns about the consequences of transportation technology
started long before. This paper reviews the literature on
urban transportation sustainability using three frameworks. First,
urban transportation can be unsustainable environmentally, economically,
and socially (the three pillars of sustainability). Second,
sustainable strategies tend to fall into two paradigms. Sustainable
Transport Technology improves current patterns of modes and
trips by consuming less resources and generating less waste.
Sustainable Travel Behavior and Built Environment takes a more
holistic approach that targets more sustainable travel choices,
recognizing that changes in the built environment that currently
constrains those choices are also essential. Third, the Planner’s
Triangle helps explain commonly encountered situations where
inherent tradeoffs can impede win-win-win strategies across environmental,
economic, and social domains. The paper concludes
with future research directions and concluding thoughts about
urban transportation and sustainability. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2013 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Data derived from visual inspection of Google Street View imagery associated with a variety of pedestrian
and road infrastructure features are analyzed with a database of pedestrian casualties. These features
include the presence of sidewalks, buffers between the road and the sidewalk, street lighting, number
of travel lanes and the presence of medians, traffic controls at intersections, and posted speed limits.
The analysis focuses on how these features affect the severity of a pedestrian casualty once it has
occurred. Other controls used in the analysis include the age of the victim, ambient lighting conditions,
and whether the vehicle driver was intoxicated. Results suggest that severity of pedestrian casualties is
associated with the lack of sidewalks and buffers, high-speed roads, roads with six or more lanes and a
median, and lack of traffic lighting when it is dark. Speed is a critical factor in determining the severity of
crash outcomes, and most road characteristics affect crash outcomes to the extent that they moderate or
facilitate high speeds. Casualties are more severe when it is dark than when it is daylight. Older pedestrians
tend to have more severe casualties. A key contribution of this work is the use of Google Street
View imagery; however, a limitation is that the analysis cannot examine the probability of a pedestrian
casualty. Implications for road safety are consistent with national efforts to make streets safer via Complete
Streets policies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Because transport planning distributes accessibility and mobility, it is increasingly understood to involve
questions of fairness and justice. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is a technique for expanding transit access through
redesign of existing roadways with dedicated bus lanes and spaced stations for rapid operation, with associated
pedestrian improvements. Such innovations prompt intriguing questions. How does BRT planning reimagine
accessibility to transport networks and urban streets, and with what implications for socio-spatial relations and
justice? We analyze plans, public debates, and interviews with key stakeholders in a proposed BRT corridor
along Chicago's diverse and busy Ashland Avenue. Results show how BRT planning “rethinks” transit networks
through purposeful reallocation of street spaces, interpreted relative to efficiency and equity. But if BRT planners
promote transit improvements and “complete” streets as questions of fairness, they confront engineering and
business interests in vehicular mobility and parking, highlighting enduring obstacles to multimodal accessibility and mobility justice. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The increasingly prevalent concept of inclusiveness in the public discourse is gaining a
foothold in the paradigm shift of street design from a predominance of vehicular traffic
towards a vision that caters to non-motorised modes and creates an urban setting conducive
to non-mobile activities. This study aims to investigate perceived importance within
a set of six dimensions of street design (i.e., accessibility, connectivity, streetscape, safety
and security, urban vibrancy, and greenery), which is an inclusive street vision and can be
contextualised in the act of visioning. A street-intercept questionnaire survey (n = 816) was
conducted in Singapore, and gender, age and transport mode use information were also
collected. Using a multivariate and graphical approach, a categorical canonical correlation
analysis was performed that highlighted the elderly and motorcyclists as groups with
potentially different perceptions. Then, univariate ordinal logistic regression models were
fitted separately on the six dimensions; gender was non-significant, while age and certain
transport modes were significant. In particular, in addition to age, the car passenger transport
mode was significant in five dimensions. Recent developments in Singapore’s urban
transport, which is undergoing rapid changes due to incremental improvement schemes
and disruptive services, such as ride hailing and bicycle sharing, are further discussed.
As mobility needs and desirable street qualities vary across transport modes, this study
serves as a precursor of further research into specific inclusive street dimensions, such as
streetscape and urban vibrancy. The results indicate that land use and transport systems
should be planned or redeveloped collaboratively to incorporate users’ aspirations. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Many communities in the United States have been adding new light rail to bus-predominant public
transit systems. However, there is disagreement as to whether opening light rail lines attracts new ri-dership or merely draws ridership from existing transit users. We study a new light rail line in Salt Lake
City, Utah, USA, which is part of a complete street redevelopment. We utilize a pre-test post-test control
group quasi experimental design to test two different measures of ridership change. The first measure is
calculated from stops along the light rail route; the second assumes that nearby bus stops might be
displaced by the rail and calculates ridership change with those stops included as baseline. Both the
simple measure (transit use changes on the complete street light rail corridor) and the “displacement”
measure (transit use changes in the one quarter mile catchmentare as around new light rail stops)
showed significant (po.01) and substantial (677%) increases in transit passengers compared to pre-light
rail bus users. In particular, the displacement analysis discredits a common challenge that when a new
light rail line opens, most passengers are simply former bus riders whose routes were canceled in favor
of light rail. The study suggests that light rail services can attract additional ridership to public transit
systems. In addition, although pre-post control-group designs require time and effort, this project underscores the benefits of such quasi-experimental designs in terms of the strength of the inferences that
can be drawn about the impacts of new transit infrastructure and services. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Modern universities seek policies to sustain the streets on their campuses by making campus streets
pedestrian-friendly. To maintain inclusive streets, campus designers and planners should consider all
users. Currently, there are efforts to evaluate street conditions for pedestrians. However, a limited range
of pedestrian facilities and abilities make the results of previous studies insufficient to evaluate and promote inclusive walking facilities. This study attempts to create a foundation for evaluating and improving
campus streets for pedestrians. This research presents pedestrian design indicators based on different
guidelines that consider various pedestrian needs. This paper also introduces the pedestrian level of
service (PLOS) for campuses, which is a measure to evaluate campus street facilities and infrastructure
for pedestrians. An analytical point system comparing existing pedestrian facilities to a standard is proposed to estimate this PLOS. Although this method can be utilized on campuses around the world, this
research uses it to assess streets on the campus of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). This method can
identify existing street problems for pedestrians and can be used to propose improvements to existing
campus streets. Since this study tries to serve all requirements of pedestrians, specifically vulnerable
users whether old or disabled, designers have room to implement accessible routes for pedestrians in
campus streets. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2014 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper aims to clearly establish the origin and evolution of the shared space concept
from a New Zealand perspective by reviewing the literature in the disciplines of both urban design
and transportation engineering. The review process involves investigating the use and function of a
public road space in the context of the changing of public expectations and how this can relate to a
number of interconnected street design approaches (e.g. traffic calming and self-explaining roads
(SERs)). These approaches have been used to minimise the influence of motor vehicles since the beginning
of the automobile era. The shared space concept, when applied in public road environments in
activity centres, has increasingly been embraced by urban planners, transportation engineers and
regulatory agencies. A shared space diverges from a conventional road where all road users are
encouraged to legitimately occupy the same road space with little physical separation. To achieve
this in a safe and efficient manner, the design aims to reduce the dominance of the motor vehicle
by promoting pedestrian and cycling activity and utilising the road space as a ‘place’ in addition
to its ‘transport’ mobility and access purposes. Given the fundamental conceptual differentiation
between a traffic-calmed street and a shared space, the paper argues that there are certain design
elements, constituting a shared space, and without them, it would be difficult for a public street to
function as a genuine shared space for all road users. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The promotion of space sharing in order to raise the quality of community living and safety
of street surroundings is increasingly accepted feature of modern urban design. In this context,
the development of a shared space simulation tool is essential in helping determine
whether particular shared space schemes are suitable alternatives to traditional street layouts.
A simulation tool that enables urban designers to visualise pedestrians and cars trajectories,
extract flow and density relation in a new shared space design, achieve solutions
for optimal design features before implementation, and help getting the design closer to
the system optimal. This paper presents a three-layered microscopic mathematical model
which is capable of representing the behaviour of pedestrians and vehicles in shared space
layouts and it is implemented in a traffic simulation tool. The top layer calculates route
maps based on static obstacles in the environment. It plans the shortest path towards
agents’ respective destinations by generating one or more intermediate targets. In the second
layer, the Social Force Model (SFM) is modified and extended for mixed traffic to produce
feasible trajectories. Since car movements are not as flexible as pedestrian
movements, velocity angle constraints are included for cars. The conflicts described in
the third layer are resolved by rule-based constraints for shared space users. An optimisation
algorithm is applied to determine the interaction parameters of the force-based model
for shared space users using empirical data. This new three-layer microscopic model can be
used to simulate shared space environments and assess, for example, new street designs. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2015 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The role of the built environment in facilitating physical activity is well recognised. However, longitudinal
studies into the effects of changes to the built environment on levels of activity and quality of life outcomes
are lacking, especially for older people. This paper presents results from a longitudinal study of ‘home
zone’ style changes to residential streets, designed to make streets more ‘liveable’ by reducing the dominance
of vehicular traffic and creating shared space. The interventions were focused in deprived areas,
where the changes followed an inclusive, community-led approach. The intervention sites were matched
with comparison sites receiving no intervention. Whilst existing studies into the outcomes of home zone
type interventions have tended to focus on tangible measures such as road casualties or traffic speeds,
this study examines broader, self-reported behavioural (i.e. activity levels and perceptions), health and
quality of life outcomes. Results were gathered pre-intervention in 2008 and then, post-intervention, in
2010 or 2011 for participants aged 65 or older. They show that interventions are associated with a significant
improvement in perceptions of how easy it is to walk on the street near home. Participants also
considered that they were significantly more active post-intervention. However, there was less evidence
of positive change in health, quality of life, frequency of activities outdoors, time spent outdoors, or better
social connectedness. One potential reason is that a greater time period post-implementation is needed
for such outcomes to become manifest. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The motion dynamics of humans in crowded built environments during evacuations are impacted by individuals’ interactions with the physical environment particularly when the geometric space of the movement is restrictive. Controlled laboratory experiments have recently been employed as a reliable data provision approach in this field. Using this approach and based on data obtained from 54 experimental scenarios, this study investigates a range of questions in relation to the collective motion of pedestrian crowds in restricted shares spaces. This includes the role of the layout of the spatial constraints as well as the influence of the movement speed level in the evacuation performance of pedestrian facilities. We explored these questions particularly for dense crowds and based on both micro-scale and macro-scale measures of pedestrian traffic. Our analyses showed that traffic efficiency is demonstrably sensitive to the physical features of the merging passages as well as the desired speed level of the crowd. The patterns of influence of the geometric constraints on traffic efficiency were by and large common across all three speed regimes that we examined. Our results also showed that under specific geometric constraints, the formation of blockages (i.e., longer queue or longer time interval between the passage of two consecutive pedestrians) is more likely. An inspection of the trajectory patterns revealed that this could be attributable to the extent to which the two flows had to mix up with each other in order to be able to merge and share the space. Certain layouts, particularly symmetric layouts, allowed the two flows to keep their separate ways after the entered the shared space, whereas other setups engendered a more noticeable mixture of movement trajectories in order for the two flows to be able to travel through the shared area. The findings have applications for the design of safe passageways when dense crowd flows enter restrictive areas. </td>

For the implementation of storage space sharing, this study proposes methods for allocating shared spaces efficiently to participating companies and for allocating costs to them. Two cost allocation methods, which are based on a linear programming (LP) model, are proposed: one using dual variables of the LP model and the other using the Lagrangian multipliers of the relaxed LP model. It is proved that the cost allocation, determined by the two methods, is an imputation in the core of the cooperative game. Using numerical experiments, it is shown that a heuristic cost allocation method based on the Lagrangian multipliers satisfies ideal properties that the competitive, as well as, the cooperative game should have. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In the past decade, transportation planners worldwide have been incorporating shared space
design elements as a way of creating pedestrian-friendly places. Streets incorporating shared space
principles tend to have reduced vehicle speeds and increased safety for vulnerable road
users. In North American cities, a shared-space approach is rarely applied to non-motorized
environments such as pedestrian malls, campuses, and parks. As cyclists and pedestrians travel at
relatively slow speeds, there is an opportunity to provide safe infrastructure to both through nonmotorized
shared spaces. Yet, little empirical evidence exists concerning the risk of pedestrian cyclist
collisions in shared spaces. Existing surrogate methods are either difficult to automate or
insufficient to describe interactions between vulnerable users. To address this research gap, a
methodological framework is proposed based on the analysis of semi-automated pedestrian-cyclist
interactions and the integration of surrogate methods in non-motorized shared space.
Several proposed surrogate safety measures (SSMs) including cyclist speed, angle of approach,
pedestrian density, and post-encroachment time are analysed to estimate the risk of pedestrian cyclist
interactions. The methodology is then applied to a case study on the McGill University
campus in Montreal, Canada, where cyclists and pedestrians coexist. User trajectories are automatically
extracted using a computer vision software to yield 2739 pedestrian-cyclist interactions
for analysis. The derived SSMs demonstrate adequate levels of safety. For example, speed and
pedestrian density are shown to be negatively correlated, while conflict rate and density are
positively correlated. Statistical differences are shown between conflict types defined based on
intersecting angle and road user configuration. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> While autonomous mobility technology is developing, comparatively less is known about how a
sociotechnical system of autonomous mobility may impact our urban living conditions. Using
Finland as a case study, this research aims to identify the possible implications of changing power
relations created by autonomous mobility technology. This study uses a theoretical and conceptual
approach grounded in the planning research tradition of Aristotelian practical judgement
(phronesis). Drawing from political theory of technology, it investigates the social relations that
may be afforded by autonomous mobility technology. Adapting a concept drawn from geography
of power, it examines how power is expressed in terms of transcripts of dominant technological
agency and hidden social context. 31 interviews of extended users in the transition (intermediaries)
revealed three dominant transcripts of technological agency associated with the
philosophy of cyberlibertarianism (liberation of the driver, safety of the driver and customer
accessibility), and four hidden transcripts of social context (restrictions on sharing street space,
loss of social safety, vulnerability of passengers, and loss of privacy). The phronetic research
tradition that was used in the study revealed several things. The impact of autonomous mobility
technology goes beyond the purely systemic, affecting the very fabric of our connection with
place and society. Failure to consider autonomous mobility technology as a sociotechnical system
that will restructure society unperceptively (technological somnambulism) may bring profound
societal changes. </td>

positively. The statistical analysis revealed that the performance criteria of ‘Pedestrian’ and
‘Safety’ had a commanding influence over the other performance measures, and with the
interconnectivity of the five objectives the perceived success of the urban shared spaces. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> At the turn of the new millennium the reform of the Italian constitution (2001) marked a change from
national to local welfare. Housing policies shifted from central state provision towards a multi-level local
governance organised into partnerships between regions, municipalities, third sector and private investors.
Lombardy, and specifically Milan, has attempted to implement in the local housing policy agenda
the principles and goals stemming from the European debate. Especially the notion of social mix has
become a keyword in the Milanese housing policy, both for new social housing developments, and for
regeneration programmes targeting existing social housing estates. Social mix is increasingly seen as a
means to avoid segregation and to enhance social cohesion, however not much attention has been
devoted so far to evaluate the effects of social mix policies on the inhabitants’ lives. This paper will focus
on the Villaggio Grazioli project, a recent example of social mix policy in Milan. The aim of the paper is to
investigate the relation between social mix and social cohesion at a neighbourhood level. At first sight,
the residents experience a strong feeling of social cohesion. However, a deeper analysis shows that some
social groups are still excluded from the local community. Social mix in itself is not sufficient to create
social cohesion. A greater role is played by active policies aimed at making residents interact and hang
together. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2014 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The social mix policy approach has become a common reaction to the multiple-disadvantage increasingly
present in public housing estates in western cities. This approach and its social effects on socially-mixed
communities have been studied widely; however the physical form or arrangement of models that such
communities are formulated around have been largely missing from this discussion. The importance of
design principles as well as the barriers to their implementation in mixed-tenure communities has been
largely overlooked. We investigate these factors in a case study of the Carlton Public Housing Estate
Redevelopment in Melbourne, Australia, using an analysis of in-depth interviews with public housing
tenants, private residents and service providers. The findings show how the implementation of design
‘principles’ was contingent on political and economic decisions made by government and private enterprise
stakeholders. Perceptions of whether the physical design of the redevelopment contributed to the lack of
successful social mix varied between tenants, government officials, private developers and private residents.
We conclude that partly due to the way that economic interests compromised the implementation
of preferred design principles undertaken in the Carlton Redevelopment Project (Stage 1), neither housing
tenure mix nor social interaction has been successfully experienced by public and private residents in the
estate. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This exploratory study examines the relationship between internal space, shared space and private housing prices.
Housing floor area is an ambiguous concept in Hong Kong because it covers a possible exaggeration of the amount of
‘private space’ exclusively enjoyed by the owner and an unidentifiable portion of ‘public space’ shared with other owners
within the development. Using hedonic pricing models, this study has found that different distributions between private
and shared space command different values from the housing buyers. Shared communal space generally exerts a
downward pressure on housing prices. The buyers are willing to pay more for the private space and some desirable forms
of communal space. A higher willingness-to-pay for the desirable attributes such as clubhouse indicates that the Hong
Kong people are increasingly concerned about the quality of living space in the built environment. This study suggests a
need of further research into the exact measurement and the different forms of housing space rather than simply taking the
stated floor space figures for granted. </td>

desired integration is still illusive in daily practice. To address this gap, the current study
uses spatial metrics, a set of methods traditionally used for studying changes in the spatial
structure of landscapes, which are translated into the domain of transport planning. It
examines how spatial metrics can be integrated into ‘‘Land Use Transport” strategy making,
and how useful they are according to the practitioners’ perceptions. A Light Rail
Transit corridor in Granada (Spain) provides the empirical focus of this research. Land
use characteristics such as: land use mixing, land use diversity and green areas connectivity
were successfully studied using spatial metrics, and they were used to map three ‘‘Land
Use Transport” strategies: (i) proximity dynamics and non-motorised modes; (ii) modal
shift from cars to Light Rail Transit system; (iii) shared spaces between motorised and
non-motorised modes. Practitioners perceived that spatial metrics could improve the
‘‘Land Use Transport” strategy-making process in comparison with traditional methods
used in practice. However, certain shortcomings related to the usability of spatial metrics
are also highlighted and discussed. This study concludes with a reflection on research challenges
for adapting spatial metrics to transport practice. </td>

streets—suggest a need to understand how various roadway users view roadway designs
meant to accommodate multiple modes. While many studies have examined bicyclists’
roadway design preferences, there has been little investigation into the opinions of
non-bicyclists who might bicycle in the future. Additionally, little research has explored
the preferences of the motorists who share roads with cyclists—despite the fact that
motorists compose the vast majority of roadway users in the United States and similarly
developed countries.
This paper presents results from an internet survey examining perceived comfort while
driving and bicycling on various roadways among 265 non-bicycling drivers, bicycling
drivers, and non-driving bicyclists in the San Francisco Bay Area. Analysis of variance tests
revealed that both drivers and bicyclists are more comfortable on roadways with separated
bicycling facilities than those with shared space. In particular, roadways with barrierseparated
bicycle lanes were the most popular among all groups, regardless of bicycling
frequency. Striped bicycle lanes, a common treatment in the United States, received mixed
reviews: a majority of the sample believed that they benefit cyclists and drivers through
predictability and legitimacy on the roadway, but the lanes were rated significantly less
comfortable than barrier-separated treatments—particularly among potential bicyclists.
These findings corroborate research on bicyclists’ preferences for roadway design and
contribute a new understanding of motorists’ preferences. They also support the U.S.
Federal Highway Administration’s efforts to encourage greater accommodation of
bicyclists on urban streets. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> While the design of urban space provides an opportunity to create places sensitised
to the manifold complexities of the body, places continue to be designed with little
understanding of the interrelationships between design, disability and space. One
issue is the absence of embodied knowledge about impairment in urban design, and
the understanding of disability as an aberration, not intrinsic to the crafting of welldesigned
environments. With the focus on vision impairment, the paper evaluates a
popular approach to improving the quality of street environments, shared space, in
which pavements and roads are merged into single and shared surfaces. Data from a
study of English local authorities show that the diverse needs of vision-impaired
people are barely recognised or given a platform to influence shared space policy. It
is suggested that this marginalisation of vision-impaired people is part of a postpolitical
condition, in which deliberative techniques, such as public consultation, are
part of a process to manage those that dissent from the preferred policy choice—i.e.
shared space. An implication is the depoliticisation of shared space policy in which
the unequal, and unjust, ways in which urban design impacts on vision-impaired
people are neither articulated nor recognised by formal policy programmes. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The expanding critical literature on Urban Agriculture (UA) makes links between the withdrawal
of state services and the institutionalisation of volunteering, while observing that challenging funding
landscapes can foster competitive environments between third-sector organisations. Where
these organisations are forced to compete for survival at the expense of collaboration, their ability
to collectively upscale and expand beneficial activities can be compromised. This paper focuses
on a lottery-funded UA project and draws predominantly on observations and interviews held
with project staff and growing group volunteers. Research conducted in Wythenshawe,
Manchester (UK), highlights difficulties experienced by organisations attempting to function in an
environment disfigured by depletion, illustrating conflicts that can arise between community
groups and charitable organisations competing for space and resources. Inter-organisational
dynamics are considered at two scales: at the grassroots level between growing groups, and at a
structural level between project partners. In a landscape scarred by local authority cutbacks and
restructures, a dearth of funding opportunities and increasingly precarious employment, external
initiatives can be met with suspicion or hostility, particularly when viewed as superfluous interventions.
The resulting ‘siege mentality’ reflects the need for organisational self-preservation but perhaps
paradoxically results in groups with similar goals and complementary ideologies working
against each other rather than in cooperation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Bicycling and walking are gaining popularity for both commuting and recreation. However, when faced
with limited right-of-way width, many transportation agencies find it impractical to designate separate
space for bicyclists in urban road way corridors, instead devoting their limited funds to other projects. As
a result, some bicyclists – feeling threatened by motor vehicles – use sidewalks for at least part of their
trip. Laws governing bicyclist use of sidewalks are not consistently enforced invarious cities and
countries. Pedestrian-bicycle shared space has rarely been studied from a pedestrian's perspective in an
urban context. Therefore, gaining a better understanding of the factors that influence pedestrian attitudes toward sharing a sidewalk with bicyclists can be useful in evaluating shared space strategies and
guiding investments in bicycle facilities. Using the responses of 114 persons to 15 carefully constructed
60-s video clips of urban sidewalks in four Chinese cities, this study characterizes pedestrian attitudes
regarding sharing sidewalks with bicycles under different sidewalk configurations. By estimating a
random parameters ordered probability model (to account for unobserved heterogeneity across respondents), we found pedestrians who wanted a “safe distance” greater than 1.5 meters were more likely
to possess a less tolerant attitude. Attitudes of pedestrians toward bicyclists on sidewalks also depend on
the presence or absence of dedicated bicycle facilities. The effects of other significant factors are also
quantified in this paper. Implications for policy makers in evaluating shared-space strategy can be drawn
from this empirical study. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Collectively owned open spaces are an integral feature of the urban residential landscape. While scholarly attention
tends to focus on the management of shared spaces within buildings, management of collectively owned
open spaces, which make up large percentages of the outside residential lot serving as gardens or courtyards, has
been limited. The dual nature of these urban environments, considered as hybrid public-private places, might
lead to a responsibility vacuum where residents feel these territories are not fully private, and municipalities
argue they are not fully public. Although these spaces are considered common, often highly visible and affect
many residents; in the case of Israel, the management strategies currently in practice are not adequate in creating
useful, safe and aesthetic places. In order to identify the main factors contributing to the neglect of these spaces,
our work draws on the study of three major cities in Israel, and applies a number of different methods, including
interviews, document analysis and on-site visits. In addition, we explore local governments’ response to the
management of these spaces, which consist of various intervention paths including management-based, community-
oriented, and planning-focused. The analysis suggests that the case of collectively owned open spaces
offers a cautionary tale on the potentially far-reaching effects of insufficiently thought-out planning, and illuminates
possible solutions. </td>

infinite-horizon look-ahead. The proposed approach includes a novel dynamic optimization algorithm
which employs a Markov decision process (MDP) and provides opportunities to revolutionize
conventional transit services that are plagued by high cost, low ridership, and general
inefficiency, particularly in disadvantaged communities and low-income areas. We use this
model to study the implications it has for such services and investigate whether it has a distinct
cost advantage and operational improvement. We develop a dynamic pricing scheme that utilizes
a balking rule that incorporates socially efficient level and the revenue-maximizing price, and an
equilibrium-joining threshold obtained by imposing a toll on the customers who join the system.
Results of numerical simulations based on actual New York City taxicab data indicate that a
competitive on-demand mobility system supported by the proposed model increases the social
welfare by up to 37% on average compared to the single-server queuing system. The study offers
a novel design scheme and supporting tools for more effective budget/resource allocation,

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Recently, the use of market segmentation techniques to promote sustainable transport has
significantly increased. Populations are segmented into meaningful groups that share similar
attitudes and preferences. This segmentation provides valuable information about how
policy options, such as pricing measures or advertising campaigns, should be designed and
promoted in order to successfully target different user groups. In this paper, we aim to
bridge between psychological, social marketing and ICT research in the field of transportation.
We explore how attitude based segments are reflected in high resolution mobility
behaviour data, crowdsourced via mobile phones. We use support vector machines to
map eight attitudinal segments, as defined under the European project SEGMENT, to the
n dimensional space defined by crowdsourced data. The success rate of the proposed
approach is 98.9%. This demonstrates the applicability of the method as a way to automatically
map attitudinal segments to a wider population based on observed mobility data
instead of using explicit attitudinal surveys. In addition, the proposed approach can facilitate
the delivery of personalised target messages to individuals (e.g. via smartphones) or at
target locations where users, belonging to specific segment, are located at specific time
windows since the data includes the time-space indications. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In the era of smart cities, Internet of Things, and Mobility-as-a-Service, private operators need to
share data with public agencies to support data exchanges for “living lab” ecosystems more than
ever before. However, it is still problematic for private operators to share data with the public
due to risks to competitive advantages. A privacy control algorithm is proposed to overcome this
key obstacle for private operators sharing complex network-oriented data objects. The algorithm
is based on information-theoretic k-anonymity and, using tour data as an example, where an
operator’s data is used in conjunction with performance measure accuracy controls to synthesize
a set of alternative tours with diffused probabilities for sampling during a query. The algorithm is
proven to converge sublinearly toward a constrained maximum entropy under certain asymptotic
conditions with measurable gap. Computational experiments verify the applicability to multivehicle
fleet tour data; they confirm that reverse engineered parameters from the diffused data
result in controllable sampling error; and tests conducted on a set of realistic routing records from
travel data in Long Island, NY, demonstrate the use of the methodology from both the adversary
and user perspectives. </td>

This Perspective Essay takes up this discussion by asking how a digital approach to UGI planning and management mediates the configuration and development of UGI and to whose benefit? This is done through a review of key issues and trends in digital approaches to UGI planning and management. We first conceptualize automation from a social, ecological, and technological interactions perspective and use this lensto present an overview of the risks and opportunities of UGI automation with respect to selected case studies.Results of this analysis are used to develop a conceptual framework for the assessment of the material and governance implications of automated UGIs. We find that, within any given perspective, the automation of UGIentails a complex dialectic between efficiency, human agency and empowerment. Further, risks and opportunities associated with UGI automation are not fixed but are dynamic properties of changing contextual tensions concerning power, actors, rules of the game and discourse at multiple scales. We conclude the paper by outlining a research agenda on how to consider different digital advances within a social, ecological, technological approach. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Non-myopic dial-a-ride problem and other related dynamic vehicle routing problems often
ignore the need for non-myopic pricing under the assumption of elastic demand, which
leads to an overestimation of the benefits in level of service and resulting inefficiencies.
To correct this problem, a new dynamic dial-a-ride policy is introduced, one that features
non-myopic pricing based on optimal tolling of queues to fit with the multi-server queueing
approximation method proposed by Hyttiä et al. (2012) for large-scale systems. By
including social optimal pricing, the social welfare of the resulting system outperforms
the marginal pricing assumed for previous approaches over a range of test instances. In
the examples tested, improvements in social welfare of the non-myopic pricing over the
myopic pricing were in the 20–31% range. For a given demand function, we can derive
the optimal fleet size to maximize social welfare. Sensitivity tests to the optimal price confirm
that it leads to an optimal social welfare while the marginal pricing policy does not. A
comparison of single passenger taxis to shared-taxis shows that system cost may reduce at
the expense of decreased social welfare, which agrees with the results of Jung et al. (2013). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The rapid developments of ubiquitous mobile computing provide planners and researchers with new opportunities to understand and build smart cities by mining the massive spatial-temporal mobility data. However, given the increasing complexity and volume of the emerging mobility datasets, it also becomes challenging to build novel analytical framework that is capable of understanding the structural properties and critical features. In this paper, we introduce an analytical framework to deal with high-dimensional human mobility data. To this end, we formulate mobility data in a probabilistic setting and consider each record a multivariate observation sampled from an underlying distribution. In order to characterize this distribution, we use a multi-way probabilistic factorization model based on the concept of tensor decomposition and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA). The model provides us with a flexible approach to understand multi-way mobility involving higher-order interactions—which are difficult to characterize with conventional approaches—using simple latent structures. The model can be efficiently estimated using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. As a numerical example, this model is applied on a four-way dataset recording 14 million public transport journeys extracted from smart card transactions in Singapore. This framework can shed light on the modeling of urban structure by understanding mobility flows in both spatial and temporal dimensions </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2017 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Investments in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are beginning to take place in the
context of smart city initiatives in many cities. Energy efficiency and emissions reduction
are becoming essential rationales for such investments. It is important, therefore, to understand
under what conditions investments in ITS in the context of smart cities produce
energy savings. We reviewed existing literature, conducted case studies and interviews,
and found that the smart cities context has transformed traditional ITS into ‘‘smart mobility”
with three major characteristics: people-centric, data-driven, and powered by bottomup
innovations.
We argue that there are four main steps for smart mobility solutions to achieve energy
savings and that several institutional, technical, and physical conditions are required at
each step. Energy savings are achieved when users change their behavior and result in less
travel, modal shift, and reduction of per-km energy consumption in the short term. Smart
mobility solutions also enable other energy saving policies or initiatives, which would
otherwise not be feasible. In the long term, users’ lifestyles could change and lead to further
energy savings.
For cities in developing countries with lower motorization, less-developed infrastructure,
less financial resources, and less institutional and technical capacity, our recommendations
to achieve benefits from smart mobility investments are: (1) involve all public and
private players in a collaborative and transparent setting; (2) develop the technical capacity
to procure and monitor information services; and (3) focus on basic infrastructure,
including a coherent road network and basic traffic management measures. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Bicycle Sharing Systems (BSS) are now ubiquitous due to their plausible environmental and social benefits promoted by municipalities, operators
and technology providers. Recent practices and literature however undermines many suggested benefits of BSS showing they mostly facilitate
transport for already privileged demographics in increasingly exclusive urban cores. Additionally, case study performance estimates in Europe and
North America commonly show low usage rates further undermining promoted benefits. In the context of urban transports existing social injustice,
energy consumption and land use, which cannot be sustained, this work, drawing on data analysis, interviews and literature and media review in
North America and Europe, presents how existing BSS deployments have intrinsic flaws. These convenient luxuries are typically not effective or less
so than familiar, proven and less technologically innovative opportunities at achieving greater cycling modal share.
This paper illustrates how with BSS deployments converge many actors, promoting success and beneficial narratives, gain advantage through
diverse outcomes while residents subsidize the services economically, through public land or advertising, while receiving few benefits.
Municipalities and decision makers regularly use BSS to promote themselves, their city, attract investment and develop local pride in representatives
and their policy. Beyond being a good example of policy boosterism and rich in rhetoric, BSS often have less effective or just outcomes than
alternative transport policies. Advertisers meanwhile utilize sustainability narratives to capitalize on new markets and commodification opportunities
while effectively undermining promoted BSS outcomes. This paper provides a critical history of BSS, summarizes their stated purposes and
benefits and utilizes a smart-city critique framework to evaluate outcomes. This work concludes that most BSS typically benefit the privileged, help
little to increase mass cycling transport and are used as easily deployable technological (false) solutions to contemporary problems while advancing
unjust tendencies to privatize public space and services. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The digital age continues its advance, bringing with it remarkable technological possibilities.
Such possibilities are founded upon an increasingly fine-grained electronic connectivity
of people, places and objects allied to powerful data gathering and processing
capabilities. Urban mobility of the future could be transformed, with developments such
as: new forms of propulsion; new forms of vehicle control; changing business models of
ownership and use; mobile technologies that equip and empower individuals; and opportunities
to undertake activities without the need to travel. ‘Smart’ is the order of the day.
Smart urban mobility conjures up a sense of new opportunity; of progress. However, what
is really meant by smart? This paper examines this question, revealing a lack of consensus
in terms of smart cities and a paucity of literature seeking to make sense of smart urban
mobility. The paper considers how smart relates to sustainable, raising concerns about
potentially dichotomous constituencies of commentators and discourses. Critical commentary
associated with smart includes caution that large corporations are exerting significant
influence in the era of smart in pursuit of goals that may not strongly align with those of
urban planners concerned with social and environmental sustainability as well as economic
prosperity. The paper puts forward and explores the following definition of smart
urban mobility: ‘‘connectivity in towns and cities that is affordable, effective, attractive
and sustainable”. This is intended to help draw the paradigms of smart and sustainable closer
together towards a common framework for urban mobility development. </td>

research focuses on the question whether e-mobility product service systems (i.e. plug-in electric
vehicles, interconnected charging infrastructure as well as charging platform and additional
services) are supportive to plug-in electric vehicle adoption in professional environments.
Our user oriented techno-economic analysis of costs and benefits is based on empirical data
originating from 109 organizational fleets participating in a field trial in south-west Germany
with in total 327 plug-in electric vehicles and 181 charging points. The results show that organizations
indicate a high willingness to pay for e-mobility product service systems. Organizations
encounter non-monetary benefits, which on average overcompensate the current higher total cost
of ownership of plug-in electric vehicles compared to internal combustion engine vehicles.
However, the willingness to pay for e-mobility charging infrastructure and services alone is
currently not sufficient to cover corresponding actual costs. The paper relates the interconnected
charging infrastructure solutions under study to the development of the internet of things and
smarter cities and draws implications on this development. </td>

The main aim of this paper is to apply a case-based learning methodology to predict barriers to a given smart and
sustainable energy project. To achieve this aim, a learning methodology is proposed and applied to the case study
of the city of Bolzano, with in SINFONIA project. SINFONIA is a European Commission Seventh Framework Programme
(FP7) project for integration of smart and sustainable energy solutions at urban district level. The proposed
methodology operates in two main steps: first, identifying and selecting the most similar European
smart and sustainable energy cases to the target-case (Bolzano within SINFONIA); second, investigating barriers
to implementation of selected cases. The results showthat the barriers fragmented ownership of properties, limited
access to capital and cost disincentives, and perception of interventions as complicated and expensive, with negative
social or environmental impacts are highly probable to occur in Bolzano within SINFONIA. The proposed methodology
is applicable and replicable for urban planners and decision-makers in different territorial levels to facilitate
and accelerate the implementation of smart and sustainable energy projects. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Geoinformation and Communication Technology (GeoICT) is being increasingly adopted to foster urban sustainability
and smart cities. Despite the burgeoning utilization of GeoICT, the development of frameworks of
components and guidelines is still at the infancy. This is due to the fact that GeoICT implementations are guided
by contextual factors and there is no one size fits all approach. This paper focuses on the topic of leveraging
GeoICT for smart sustainable cities by examining the Saudi Arabian experience using information from the
literature, government websites, official documents, newspaper articles and personal interviews. This study
reviews the definitions, typologies, and frameworks of implementing GeoICT and smart cities. It highlights case
studies of smart city development in Saudi Arabia. A comparison of the Saudi case studies with frameworks and
practices found in the literature is presented. This paper concludes with policy implications for Saudi Arabia and
lessons for GeoICT and smart city development. It is concluded that local context has an influence on the implementation
of smart cities, ICT infrastructure is necessary but not sufficient for developing smart cities and
blending top-down with bottom-up approaches is essential. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> With the predicted world population growth of 83 million people per year (increasing 1.09% year on year)
compounded with a strong trend for migration to urban centres, there is a developing interest by academics,
industry and government to the digitalisation of the built environment and its potential impact on private
enterprises, public services and the broader context of society. The governments around the world and others are
aiming to guide and standardise this process by developing an array of standards to support this digitalisation,
most notably on Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Smart Cities Framework. Furthermore, the advancement
of the Internet of Things (IoT) is creating a highly flexible, dynamic and accessible platform for the
exchange capture and of information. There is a risk that this information on the built environment is quickly
becoming unmanageable, and the value of that information is quickly becoming lost. This paper presents a smart
asset alignment framework that creates an alignment between the information captured at the infrastructure
asset level and citizen requirements within a Smart City framework. The framework contributes to the debate on
designing and developing Smart City solutions in a way that will deliver value to the citizens. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Besides responding to challenges of rapid urbanization and growing traffic congestion, the development
of smart transport systems has attracted much attention in recent times. Many promising initiatives have
emerged over the years. Despite these initiatives, there is still a lack of understanding about an appropriate
definition of smart transport system. As such, it is challenging to identify the appropriate indicators of
‘smartness’. This paper proposes a comprehensive and practical framework to benchmark cities according
to the smartness in their transportation systems. The proposed methodology was illustrated using a set of
data collected from 26 cities across the world through web search and contacting relevant transport
authorities and agencies. Results showed that London, Seattle and Sydney were among the world’s top
smart transport cities. In particular, Seattle and Paris ranked high in smart private transport services
while London and Singapore scored high on public transport services. London also appeared to be the
smartest in terms of emergency transport services. The key value of the proposed innovative framework
lies in a comparative analysis among cities, facilitating city-to-city learning. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Most of the methodologies available in the scientific literature for measuring ongoing sustainable efforts at
municipal levels are from affluent regions (Europe, US, and Canada). Due to context idiosyncrasies, the models
available to measure ongoing sustainable efforts in affluent cities are not suitable for cities in Latin America.
Issues related to the lack of infrastructure, the absence of primary and sustainable services, and the problems
derived from economic, social, and political environment constraints, which are remarkable in some Latin
American cities, have been mostly overcome in the western global north cities. A mere reproduction of successful
technological solutions adopted by some cities of the Global North does not mean that the results achieved there
will be equally obtained in Latin America. Latin American cities are unevenly developed and in need of different
and customized solutions. In the absence of a conceptual and widely accepted methodology to evaluate the
smartness of a city considering the Latin America context and in accordance to the literature, this research
proposes an innovative model and indicators, levelling up the importance of dimensions less remarkable in
previous models. Latin American cities must use their own model to measure their ongoing sustainable efforts
that consider the idiosyncrasies of the region while not being tempted to use models from affluent regions,
avoiding the risk of reiterating a top-bottom approach and thus using an inappropriate tool. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Social media and online communication have changed the way citizens engage in all aspects of lives from
shopping and education, to how communities are planned and developed. It is no longer one-way or two- way communication. Instead, via networked all-to-all communication channels, our citizens engage on urban issues in a complex and more connected way than ever before. So government needs new ways to listen to its citizens.
The paper comprises three components. Firstly, we build on the growing discussions in the literature focused on
smart cities, on one hand, and social media research, on the other, to capture the diversity of citizen voices and
better inform decision-making. Secondly, with the support of the Australian Federal Government and in collaboration
with the local government partners, we collect citizen voices from Twitter on selected urban projects.
Thirdly, we present preliminary findings in terms of quantity and quality of publicly available online data
representing citizen concerns on the urban matters. By analyzing the sentiments of the citizen voices captured
online, clustering them into topic areas, and then reevaluating citizen's sentiments within each cluster, we
elaborate the scope and value of technologically-enabled opportunities in terms of enabling participatory local
government decision making processes. </td>

developing world. In this profile, we feature the city of Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, India. Chennai
is the largest industrial commercial center in South India; it is often referred as the ‘‘Detroit of India’’ and
the ‘‘Gateway to South India.’’ In recent decades, large industrial facilities have been established in
Chennai and its suburbs—resulting in large-scale population growth. However, this explosive growth
has strained the urban infrastructure of this prominent city. In this profile, we provide an overview of
Chennai’s urban history from social, economic, political, and environmental perspectives. We highlight
the current and future challenges faced by the city, and we argue that it is well poised to leverage emerging
smart city technologies. However, to effectively implement these technologies, city administrators
need to undertake several measures; for example, a database capturing all dimensions of the city must
be developed. By clearly delineating the urban planning and policy efforts to the present and offering
a way forward, this paper contributes to the growing literature on smart cities and the unique urban
challenges faced by cities in the developing world. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Smartphones present new forms of spatiality and sociality for cities worldwide. The sudden outburst in smartphone
technologies has revolutionised human relations creating new possibilities of encounter and connectivity.
This paper examines people's smartphone usage patterns and highlights how this is increasing human vulnerabilities
in cities with resultant wider societal implications. Drawing on the theory of vulnerability, Hofstede's
cultural dimension theory and carrying out semi-structured interviews in the United Kingdom and Ghana, the
paper reveals that the current scale of usage and addiction to smartphones and social media are fostering
emerging forms of everyday vulnerabilities. Victimisation, privacy breach, home emergencies and road accidents
are prevalent vulnerabilities in both Accra and London. By comparing participants' smartphone usage patterns
and their motives for adopting or ignoring certain social media practices, the study illustrates how the concept of
attitudinal vulnerability extends our understanding of Hofstede's theory of collectivism and individualism. While
the finding from Accra complicates Hofstede's collectivism label as there seems to be a loss of genuine sense of
care and people-centeredness among participants it confirms individualism tendencies among the participants in
London though some tendencies of ‘virtual collectivism’ were observed. In conclusion, the study emphasises how
significant behavioural changes among smartphone users can reduce human-induced vulnerabilities in cities. By
so doing, we add weight to the literature that focuses on the importance of developing context-specific cuttingedge
ICT policies vis-à-vis building smart, safe and sustainable cities. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The last decades in urban design research are characterised by a focus on technological aspects of cities which is
commonly known as the smart city strategy. The concerns and interests of citizens are coming to the forefront
nowadays with the awareness that a liveable city does not only consist of good infrastructure and sustainable
energy supply but also citizen input and feedback. In this paper, we present Citizen Design Science as a new
strategy for cities to integrate citizens' ideas and wishes in the urban planning process. The approach is to
combine the opportunity of crowdsourcing opinions and thoughts by citizens through modern information and
communication technology (ICT) with active design tools. The active design feedback from a city's inhabitants is
identified as a yet missing but essential way towards a responsive city. We therefore propose a system to merge
Citizen Science and Citizen Design, which requires a structured evaluation process to integrate Design Science
methods for urban design.
We show examples of existing approaches of Citizen Design Science and present the Quick Urban Analysis Kit
(qua-kit) as an application of this methodology. The toolkit allows users to move geometries in given environments
and provides the opportunity for non-experts to express their ideas for their neighbourhood or city. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> City managers need indicators for target setting, performance assessment, monitoring, management and decision-making purposes. The choice of the most suitable indicator framework is crucial, but difficult, as it requires
expert knowledge. To help cities in their choice, this paper compares seven recently published indicator standards
for Smart sustainable cities. A taxonomy was developed to evaluate each of their 413 indicators against
five conceptual urban focuses (types of urban sustainability and smartness), ten sectoral application domains
(energy, transport, ICT, economy, etc.) and five indicator types (input, process, output, outcome, impact). The
results clearly discriminate between indicator standards suited for evaluating the implementation of predominantly
smart city approaches versus standards more focused on sustainability assessment. A further distinction
is possible in standards almost fully oriented towards impacts reached, and standards that allow for
progress evaluation according to steps in the implementation process. Some standards provide a narrow focus on
output indicators evaluating the progress in implementing smart urban ICT solutions (e.g. number of smart
meters installed). Cities are encouraged to complement such evaluations with impact indicators that demonstrate
the effects of those solutions. This paper provides guidance for city managers and policy makers to select
the indicators and standard that best correspond to their assessment need and goals, and align with their stage in
Smart sustainable city implementation. </td>

Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics – workers at the level of the firm and at the city-/regional level in Germany. It also looks into whether the presence of these two groups of workers has greater benefits for
larger cities than smaller locations, thus justifying policies to attract these workers in order to make German
cities ‘smarter’. The empirical analysis is based on a probit estimation, covering 115,000 firm-level observations
between 1998 and 2015. The results highlight that firms that employ creative and STEM workers are more
innovative than those that do not. However, the positive connection of creative workers to innovation is limited
to the boundaries of the firm, whereas that of STEM workers is as associated to the generation of considerable
innovation spillovers. Hence, attracting STEM workers is more likely to end up making German cities smarter

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The concept of Smart City (SC) as a means to enhance the life quality of citizen has been gaining increasing
importance in the agendas of policy makers. However, a shared definition of SC is not available and it
is hard to identify common global trends. This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the
notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural
resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people.
It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio
of domains covered by a city’s best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and
at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might
have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution
patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural
urban variables are likely to influence a city’s digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC
strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component
to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city
managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards
the most appropriate domains of implementation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The “smart city” is a set of policies and programs that aim to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of municipal
services, encourage urban (re)development, facilitate private investment, and improve quality of life
through investing in information and communication technologies. Yet critics contend that the benefits of investment
and (re)development programs are not shared equally and there is need for better understanding
diverse lived experiences of community members. This paper highlights local voices and lived experiences amid
physical and social change in downtown Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, a city that is actively pursuing a smart city
agenda. Drawing on data collected from a community workshop that included representatives from local government,
technology and start-up sectors, community service providers, and community activists, we adopt a
Creative Analytic Practice (CAP) approach and present a set of hybrid vignettes centered on the experiences of
these stakeholder groups. The vignettes highlight differing expectations for the role of technology in promoting
quality of life and illustrate a struggle to translate aspirations for collaboration and equity into on-the-ground
action. We argue that CAP is an effective tool for presenting and enhancing the inclusiveness and accessibility of
smart city discussions and debates. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Smart cities are emerging in most parts of the world. The cost-benefit analysis of such initiatives should include
an unbiased consideration of potential procurement modes, especially when a substantial investment is entailed
to scale up projects to the city level. Despite the enticing trend of public private partnerships (PPPs), city
governments should evaluate the available options using an objective approach such as Multi-Attribute Utility
Analysis (MAUA). The technique takes into account prioritized assessment criteria (which are tailor-made for smart city projects) and the relative utilities of the procurement options in meeting the criteria.
The methodology of MAUA is demonstrated through a questionnaire survey and a focus group meeting involving
public and private sector practitioners, and applied to 8 types of common smart city projects in Hong
Kong, which is one of the metropolises earmarked to become a smart city by putting concepts into practice.
Results show that not all projects are best suited to PPP and that there may be divergent views between the
public and private sectors, with possibilities for a compromised decision which both sectors would accept. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The paper focusses on the concept of a smart city and its specific components in relation to size of the city. Smart
cities are a topic whose key importance is being increasingly recognised across both academic disciplines and
urban planning. The idea of a smart city is a dream of urban planners all over the world, and a subject of many
research and business initiatives as well as policy debates. As cities vary considerably in size, it is important to
ask if the size influences the level of selected indicators of smart cities. Our main presumption is that the
development level of indicators of smart cities varies in cities of different size. Our scientific objective is to find a
simple understandable model linking the categorical variable “city size” to a group of smart city indicators. Our
data set contains 26 smart city indicators for 158 European smart cities, divided into two sizes: medium-sized
cities and larger cities. We draw from the methodology of “European Smart Cities” elaborated by the Vienna
University of Technology (Project ID: 314704) that classify European smart cities and smart city indicators by
considering their size.
Analysing the statistics by using decision tree modelling, we identify the most significant indicators of smart
cities that can divide smart cities into size categories with impressive 96.2% correct classification. Besides excellent
classification result based on real empirical data, several research results overturn common assumptions
about smart cities.
Based on the research results the paper also highlights intriguing future challenges in smart city research and
policy development. Several research results have policy implications and might be useful for urban planners,
policy representatives and decision makers. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Building on the understanding that the representations that underpin slum policies play an important role in the management and reproduction of informality, the
aim of this paper is to identify some of the representations used in the governance of slums through two case studies: the upgrading policies of Rio de Janeiro's favelas,
Brazil, and the governing of Stellenbosch's informal settlements, South Africa. Slum policies are influenced by the use of technologies, defined in this paper both as
accounting techniques that stabilise the representations of informality and as technological artefacts used as means of intervention. Results show that the representations
of slums used in the policies analysed contribute to the reproduction of informality by (i) representing slums as places of uncertainty and uncontrollability,
(ii) affirming the need of experts and technical knowledge to correct the material, legal and knowledge deficits through which slums are represented,
and (iii) focusing on the individual and household level and disregarding the relational character of poverty. These representations are influenced by sociotechnical
imaginaries of sustainable and smart cities, through which the social orders that produce informality and social exclusion remain unquestioned. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Smart city approaches in city planning have gained significant momentum in the recent past. While proponents
argue that smart cities will bring positive social change by the adoption of ICTs, enriched governance and human
capital among the citizenry, opponents point out about the negative effects and gaps exist in their planning and
execution. Despite efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the concept and the way it
has been adopted and implemented. The roles of various players, especially the central role of the private sector,
is often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations from various stakeholders make the
potential implementation strategies even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field to
date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning, which limit our knowledge about the ‘real’
smart city and its implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such uncertainty at the
conceptual level, and the heightened importance given by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights
the need for proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the building of smart cities and,
thereby, proposes a 3RC framework, consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical schools,
which critically analyses various stages in the development of the field. The overall aim of the paper is to
understand how smart cities differ in their meanings, intentions and ‘offerings’. </td>

technological strategies to make smart cities, however, the changes induced by those strategies have not been
comprehensively understood. In this regard, the purpose of this paper is to identify the results of smart city
development using the systematic literature review method. We reviewed 55 papers and found 12 positive and 4
negative results are frequently mentioned. Among 12 positive results, six were purely hypothetical without any
evidence: (1) enhancing citizen involvement, (2) protecting environment, (3) facilitating social development, (4)
facilitating sustainable development, (5) fostering innovation, and (6) increasing social capital. There is relatively
less attention to negative results. Two out of four negative results are purely hypothetical: (1) privacy and
security issues and (2) diminishing freedom of speech and democracy. Further studies are needed in discovering
the evidence for purely hypothetical impacts and comparing smart city development in advanced and emerging

governance </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Infrastructure modernization is a central concern in many cities of the developing world. Local governments
struggle to provide adequate public services under budgetary constraints and vast spatial and economic inequalities.
After the demise of the centralized modernist planning paradigm, current approaches to urban development
focus on public-private partnerships, resulting in networks of dependency that involve multiple
stakeholders and complex relationships of accountability. This stakeholder complexity complicates decision
making, but can also lead to new social practices and participatory models of infrastructure governance.
This paper presents the results of a qualitative study of social practices surrounding the provision and
modernization of streetlight and electricity in Paco, Manila, enacted by formal and informal actors. Drawing
from the case study, literature on organizational improvisation and improvisational governance (Martijn Hartog,
2015), we propose a model of infrastructure governance that is based on the concept of improvisation. Based on
ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with city officials, planners, residents and local activists, we develop the
notion of improstructure as a conceptual model for understanding infrastructure governance as an improvisational
process of “call and response” among a diverse set of actors.
We apply this perspective to ongoing modernization efforts by the city of Manila and its utility companies,
involving smart city technologies including sensor networks, drone mapping, and data analytics. We argue that
despite the placeless and generic rhetoric surrounding these technologies, they constitute improvisational responses
to local conditions. We conclude by formulating design principles for improvisational infrastructure
governance, which are not limited to the Global South, but also apply in developed countries. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The drive towards open data aims at improving government transparency, motivating citizen participation and
unlocking commercial innovation. However, various intertwining barriers hinder the adoption of open data.
They are stemming from legislation and licensing, technology and operation, use level, institution and governance,
as well as economic considerations. Through the use of social network analysis (SNA), this study
identified 43 barriers faced by stakeholders in an open data project in Hong Kong and investigated their interdependencies.
Hong Kong was selected as a representative case due to its relatively low ranking in the Global
Open Data Index (24th) and poor data quality. It was found that the lack of an open data policy should be tackled
as a matter of priority to provide technical guidance for the public sector, ensure data quality and achieve
expected outcomes. It is also necessary to improve the IT literacy/mindset of the public sector, refine the
governance structure relating to the delivery of open data initiatives, encourage engagement from private entities
and provide a feedback loop for users. This study explored the interrelationships between various barriers
to open data adoption and proposes practical recommendations to enhance open data development in the
context of emerging “smart cities”. </td>

civic hacking, running various kinds of workshops and engaging with local citizens to co-create digital interventions
and apps aimed at ‘solving’ local issues. Five approaches to LL are outlined and discussed in relation to
vacancy and gentrification: pop-up initiatives, university-led activities, community organised venues/activities,
citizen sensing and crowdsourcing, and tech-led regeneration initiatives. Notwithstanding the potential for
generating temporary and independent spaces for transferring digital competences and increasing citizens'
participation in the SC, we argue LL foster largely a form of participation framed within a model of civic
stewardship for ‘smart citizens’. While presented as horizontal, open, and participative, LL and civic hacking are
rooted often in pragmatic and paternalistic discourses and practices related to the production of a creative
economy and a technocratic version of SC. As such, by encouraging a particular kind of re-use of vacant space,
LLs are used actively to bolster the Smart City discourse, as part of the more general neoliberalization of urban
political economy. We discuss these approaches and issues generally, drawing on previous fieldwork and with
respect to a case study of Dublin, Ireland. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The global trend in urban planning is moving towards smart city (SC) development. This involves a combination
of smart infrastructure, innovative technologies and the use of ‘soft assets’ to create more effective integration of
the changes within each urban community. This paper outlines and analyses a framework to measure soft assets
in SC implementation to assist policy discussions in urban development. The different approaches to identifying
and measuring intangible or soft assets by leading researchers, practitioners, and public organizations are reviewed
and evaluated. Fundamentally, intangible/soft assets are unique, and context-dependent by nature. They
are powerful assets creating value and are connected to other assets to yield outcomes and impact according to
alignment to SC objectives. Reviewing several approaches to measurement clearly indicates that the way intangible/
soft assets are addressed differ according to different frameworks used, including the accounting framework,
strength of management control, and using the assets as an integral part of knowledge management.
These tools make it possible to identify, measure and understand the roles of soft assets and explain how they are
intricately linked at multi-dimensional and multi-tier levels of urban development. Effective use of soft assets
greatly strengthens the ability of a city administration or Local Government Unit (LGU) to provide innovative
solutions and create value if the assets are optimized and aligned with the SC development goals. The value
creation framework is also changed and adapted accordingly. Thus understanding SC effectiveness is increased
by properly defining and providing an evaluation framework for soft assets which in turn assists policy makers
and LGU administration make SCs more sustainable. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The rapid proliferation of smart city (SC) projects is a response to the challenges posed by rapid urbanization
such as energy shortage, economic reconstruction (the drive towards higher productivity and efficiency) and
demographic increase. Ubiquitous information communication technologies (ICTs) in SCs enable people to
understand and manage cities more efficiently and sustainably, thus improving their life quality. However, a
number of potential pitfalls have been noted in the development of SC. This study aims at identifying potential
pitfalls in the development of SCs and filling a knowledge gap in this domain. Based on an extensive literature
review, four major pitfalls are categorized as system information insecurity, personal privacy leakage, information
islands, and digital divide. Possible causes and adverse effects of these pitfalls are discussed with the
aid of three international case reviews. In addition, this study looks into existing assessment schemes of SC
performance that are mainly focused on the positive and functional capability, but sparingly evaluate the possible
downsides. It is argued that a SC cannot claim to be successful by solely measuring how much it has done or
what it aims to achieve. While most studies focus on the benefits of SCs, this research reveals the challenges
facing city planners. It contributes to the body of knowledge in this regard and also provides an insight into the
subject matter. A framework for conducting further research on mitigating potential SC pitfalls has been laid. It
is intended to inform practitioners, researchers and policymakers to develop proactive solutions concerning both
technological and non-technological aspects at an early stage of SC developments. </td>

cities’ </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Damion J. Bunders, Krisztina Varró </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Recently, the concept of the smart city has gained growing popularity. As cities worldwide have set the aim to
harness digital technologies to their development, increasing focus came to lie on the potential challenges and
concerns related to data-driven urban practices. In the existing literature, these challenges and concerns have
been dominantly approached from a pragmatic approach based on the a priori assumed ‘goodness’ of the smart
city; for a small group of critics, the very notion of the smart city is questionable. This paper takes the middleway
by interrogating how municipal and civil society stakeholders problematize the challenges and concerns
related to data-driven practices in five Dutch cities, and how they act on these concerns in practice. The lens of
problematization posits that the ways of problematizing data-driven practices contribute to their actual enactment,
and that this is an inherently political process. The case study shows that stakeholders do not only perceive
practical challenges but are widely aware of and are (partly) pro-actively engaging with perceived normative ethical
and societal concerns, leading to different (sometimes inter-related) technological, legal/political, organizational,
informative and participative strategies. Nonetheless, the explicit contestation of smart city policies
through these strategies remains limited in scope. The paper argues that more research is needed to uncover the
structural-institutional dynamics that facilitate and/or prevent the repoliticization of smart city projects. </td>

the city's story so far. We take the position of critical scholars who are engaged in a live smart cities project
that involves the measurement of air quality by using sensor tools. As the project is still ongoing, the final results
of the work are yet to be seen, but, nonetheless worth documenting. This article is composed as an early analysis
of the air quality sensing project as a framework for the larger smart city story of Christ church. It provides an
overview of the experiences and lessons learned about the implementation of new technologies in a post disaster
environment.We examine how the narrative of the smart city is constructed, with focus on the terminology
used by citizens, academicians, government and corporations. We then argue that top-down technocratic solutions
to urban problems alone do not suffice to improve life in the city; rather, they can result in misaligned
expectations or outcomes for stakeholders at the government and citizen level. We conclude by suggesting
that citizen-led initiatives may be a way to promote more nuanced and inclusive ways of addressing local
urban problems in a smart cities context. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Despite the ongoing discussion of the recent years, there is no agreed definition of a ‘smart city’, while
strategic planning in this field is still largely unexplored. Inspired by this, the purpose of this paper
was to identify the forces shaping the smart city conception and, by doing so, to begin replacing the currently
abstract image of what it means to be one. The paper commences by dividing the recent history of
smart cities into two large sections – urban futures and the knowledge and innovation economy. The urban
futures strand shows that technology has always played an important role in forward-looking visions
about the city of the future. The knowledge and innovation economy strand shows that recent technological
advancements have introduced a whole new level of knowledge management and innovation capabilities
in the urban context. The paper proceeds to explicate the current technology push and demand pull
for smart city solutions. On one hand, technology advances rapidly and creates a booming market of
smart city products and solutions around it. On the other hand, there is demand on the side of cities that
seek to address the problems of efficiency and sustainability, making the ground fertile for a smart city
product economy. The research route of this paper eventually allows the identification of the underlying
– and often forgotten – principles of what it means to be ‘smart’ in an urban context and yields conclusions
about strategic planning for the development of smart cities today. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2017 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper develops a critical understanding of the smart city by investigating the values and ideas that underpin
this concept and how they are translated into practice. It suggests that, despite private companies and municipalities
promoting the smart city as a revolutionary utopia, this utopia is, on the contrary, an expression of the
neoliberal ideology. The case study of the Italian city of Genoa shows that the smart city utopia acts as a
generator of a collective imaginary while promoting the interests of business elites and diverting the attention
away from urgent urban problems, such as urbanization. The neoliberal ideology influences the framing of these
problems by favoring business-led technological solutions rather than political and long-term urban planning.
The study suggests that this business-led utopia has important implications in terms of accountability of the
actors involved. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cities worldwide are attempting to transform themselves into smart cities. Recent cases and studies show that a
key factor in this transformation is the use of urban big data from stakeholders and physical objects in cities.
However, the knowledge and framework for data use for smart cities remain relatively unknown. This paper
reports findings from an analysis of various use cases of big data in cities worldwide and the authors' four
projects with government organizations toward developing smart cities. Specifically, this paper classifies the
urban data use cases into four reference models and identifies six challenges in transforming data into information
for smart cities. Furthermore, building upon the relevant literature, this paper proposes five considerations
for addressing the challenges in implementing the reference models in real-world applications. The
reference models, challenges, and considerations collectively form a framework for data use for smart cities. This
paper will contribute to urban planning and policy development in the modern data-rich economy. </td>

paper questions in an innovative way their appropriations of the phenomenon. Smart City is considered as an
instrument, following the theory of Lascoumes and Le Galès (2007). Is the Smart City a functional instrument: a
kind of evidence and a pragmatic solution at disposal or a public policy instrument: not neutral, provoking
debates and influencing policies? An empirical analysis is carried on based on a survey among 193 Belgian actors
active in the domain. The results show that the Instrument theory is relevant to analyse the actors' appropriation,
which do not follow a homogeneous trend. In fact, each actor follows his own logics which will be interesting to
study. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This research applies a unique conceptual model and methodology incorporating popularity, commitment, and
virality to measure the social media engagement with residents and visitors of smart cities and how they
communicate ‘smart’ elements and their brands. Digital content analysis was applied to a sample of ten Spanish
smart cities (including Barcelona, Bilbao, Madrid, Seville and Valencia, among others), with measurable and
quantifiable elements of engagement (e.g., likes, shares and comments). The smart cities analysed achieved
acceptable, but rudimentary, levels of engagement via social media using Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
However, they displayed weaknesses related to their image and branding as well as the effectiveness with which
they communicated their smart characteristics. The main implication of this research is that these Spanish smart
cities have considerable scope to improve their use of social media to enhance their communications and
branding. Greater emphasis is required on delivering emotional (affective) messages and a higher priority needs
to be given to business and business event travellers and those visiting friends and relatives. </td>

The case of Vienna </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In recent years many initiatives have been developed under the Smart City label in a bid to provide a response to
challenges facing cities today. The concept has evolved from a sector-based approach to a more comprehensive
view that places governance and stakeholders' involvement at the core of strategies. However, Smart City implementation
requires lowering the scale from the strategy to the project level. Therefore, the ability of Smart
City initiatives to provide an integrated and systematic answer to urban challenges is constantly being called into
question. Stakeholder involvement in both the projects and the city strategy is key to developing a governance
framework that allows an integrated and comprehensive understanding. This can only be done if Smart City
strategies take the stakeholders' opinion into account and seek a compromise between their views and the
implementation of the strategy.
Multiple attempts have been made to analyse Smart Cities, but tools are needed to understand their complexity
and reflect the stakeholders' role in developing Smart City initiatives and their capacity to face urban
challenges. This paper pursues two objectives: (A) to develop a conceptual model capable of displaying an
overview of (a) the stakeholders taking part in the initiative in relation to (b) the projects developed and (c) the
challenges they face; and (B) to use this model to synthesise the opinion of different stakeholders involved in
Smart City initiatives and compare their attitudes to the key projects implemented in a corresponding SC
strategy. The methodology combines project analysis with surveys and interviews with different groups of key
stakeholders (governments, private companies, universities and research centres, and civil society) through text
analysis. The conceptual model is developed through discussions with different European stakeholders and is
applied to the case of the Vienna Smart City strategy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The smart energy city is an emerging concept in urban development, aiming to optimize urban energy systems
and improve the quality of life for citizens. However, smart energy city development requires a well-defined
and consistent conceptual core in order to ensure its accurate interpretation and successful implementation.
This research aims to define smart energy city development not only in a theoretical context, but also in terms
of practical solutions.We adopt the 5W+1H (why, what, who, where,when, how) model integrated with literature
review and expert knowledge elicitation, i.e., focus groups and interviews. This results in: (i) clarification of
general interrelationship between smart energy city, smart city, and sustainable city; (ii) a holistic, multidisciplinary,
and comprehensive conceptual framework of smart energy city, revealing its principles, objectives, domains
of intervention, stakeholders, and time and spatial scales; and (iii) a set of smart energy practical
solutions and technologies categorized in the eight domains of intervention: buildings and districts, transportation
and mobility, energy and ICT (information and communication technology) infrastructures, collaborative
planning, consumer behavior management, energy and data management, aswell as two cross-cutting domains.
We suggest that sustainable, rational, and integrated application of new technologies, collaboration of multiple
stakeholders, and integration of multiple urban energy domains, main streamed in energy specific targets, enable
distinguishing real from labeled smart energy city development. We suggest that smart energy solutions are
mostly effective when combined with other sustainable solutions. This research is applicable for all smart energy
city stakeholders, particularly decision makers and researchers, in order to enhance a common and comprehensive
understanding of the smart energy city concept and its practical solutions to foster sustainable smart energy
city development. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Currently, when discussing the development of urban areas in post-socialist countries, it is common to highlight
a new stage of urbanisation known as smart city creation. Nowadays, increasingly more cities are labelled as
intelligent or smart; however, there is no clear-cut definition that specifies the criteria for considering a city as
intelligent or smart. The existing sets of criteria are relatively ambiguous and have different priorities depending
on the region. The socio-economic transformation of post-socialist countries generated new circumstances in
terms of managing cities, especially in social and governance aspects. European funding allows for building
smart infrastructure. Thus, it is essential to determine whether, to what degree and on what grounds postsocialist
cities may be considered smart in the entire context of their human and technical dimensions. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> There are significant activities in the housing sector that deserve the
attention of those interested in the smart city. Of particular interest is
the intersection between changing housing markets, new sharing
economies, and smart cities. This paper is situated firmly at this intersection.
While there is a burgeoning literature on both smart homes and
cities, less attention has been paid to the way smart materializes in
housing. Four ways in which smart housing is materializing are identified:
‘Housing on demand’; policy and housing hacks; smart economies
driving smart housing needs; and new sharing economies.
Drawing upon existing literature and exploratory empirical data this
paper argues that smart housing emerges in the political and market
responses at the intersections of housing, smart cities and new sharing
economies. </td>

production of knowledge-based industries. Local governments are recognizing the opportunity of this paradigm
shift to improve services, create more efficient policies, and increase the wellbeing of their citizens. These new
tools create the possibility for local governments to respond differently to “wicked problems” facing cities,
including increasing chronic disease prevalence. Using lung and skin cancers as case studies, we present smart
prevention as a novel approach that uses smart city-enabled built environment monitoring to trigger local cancer prevention
policies. First, we present results of a scoping review we conducted to describe mechanisms by which
features in urban built and social environments are hypothesized to contribute to lung cancer and skin cancer.
We systematically searched fourteen electronic databases, yielding 47 articles that examined associations between
built and social environment features and lung cancer (n=34), and/or built and social environment
features and skin cancer (n=13). Second, we present a narrative review of smart city theory and governance.
Third, we use findings from both reviews to draw conceptual links between cancer prevention and SCC – presenting
a hypothetical suite of built environment and policy interventions to prevent lung and skin cancer. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cities around the world are under pressure from population growth, frenetic global economic restructuring,
and climatic perturbations. Some, like London, attract an excess of speculative, momentum or
tax-informed inward investment to finance their intensification. Provincial towns, on the other hand,
which sustain extractive metropolii, can wither without capital or talent. Sensible planning and calibrated
regional investment is the antidote to polarisation but confronts an apparent ‘smart’ or ‘sustainable’
conundrum. Grandiose, technical megaprojects like Songdo or Masdar cities and sprawling,
disconnected estates are an anathema. We articulate a putative smart and sustainable solution
(‘smart-SUR’) with ‘institutional’, ‘project’ and innovative ‘funding’ components and explore
mega-urban regeneration projects in the UK and Holland. Smart-SUR has geographical, procedural and
teleological aspects. Its mechanism involves local engagement, institutional strengthening, tight project
screening and innovative regenerative funding. Its outcome are inclusive, measured, and coordinated
transformations which ‘sweat’ existing assets, counter the long-tail of educational failure, and catalyse
productive local innovation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2017 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 20 years after the appearance of literature evidence and the launch of the first, pioneering cases, the smart city
domain remains ambiguous and generates an increasing argument with regard to its feasibility and potential. Indeed,
today the smart city domain is being characterized by an emerging market that provides novel solutions for
cyber-physical integration in the urban space; a competitive standardization arena that attempts to clarify the
domain and homogenize these solutions; a growing network of city alliances, forums and market places that
aim to bring together scientists, practitioners and city governments in an attempt to define a common urban future;
and a promising international network of scholars that studies and evolves the domain. Nevertheless, a
“common understanding” of what smart city is or could be missing and generates questions regarding whether
a “smart utopia” - that is the outcome of the “wedding” of vendors and local governments - drives the above efforts
and leaves out real community problems. The aim of this paper is to perform an analysis of 10 representative
international city cases that claim to be smart. The analysis is based on a multi-method that combines literature
evidence, official websites and reports, narrative city walks, and interviews with corresponding officials. The outcomes
distinguish utopia from reality, introduce a pool of evidence that can justify whether a city can claim to be
smart and depict a brief view of the future smart city. </td>

technology-related sectors.
Using information society and science and technology statistics for NUTS 2 statistical regions from the Eurostat
database, we construct two synthetic indices for cities based on ICT use and capability, and these are used to
group the cities into clusters. We then study the relationship between the ICT indices and economic development,
taking wealth and intellectual capital as a measurement of knowledge-based European cities. The results
show that both factors, use and capability, are significant but particularly so regarding investment in R&amp;D and

the general socio-economic situation have changed, primarily because of the ongoing economic crisis. As
a result, other discourses are emerging in the field of urban branding, with a meaningful divide between
the ‘internal’ dimension of branding (messages directed to inhabitants and city users) and its ‘external’
dimension. Specifically, the article considers the role and heritage of ‘old’ discourses on culture and creativity
and the diffusion of new branding messages related to food and to the imagery of the ‘smart city’. </td>

analysis of the determinants of urban attractiveness </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> João Romão, Karima Kourtit, Bart Neuts, Peter Nijkamp </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article presents a structural modeling analysis of the performance determinants of urban attractiveness, in
terms of resident population and international tourism demand, in 40 global cities. The analysis focuses on the
impacts of a diverse set of innovative drivers of urban value creation and sustainable solutions for city development
(urban functions), which are collectively subsumed under the heading of ‘sustainable smart city’.
Recognizing that the dynamics and growth processes related to these urban functions may have different impacts
on different types of stakeholders, potentially leading to the emergence of serious conflicts between guests/
visitors and residents, we aim to derive model-based implications for urban and tourism management in the
cities concerned in order to move towards the sustainable future city as ‘a place 4 all’. The results of our latent
growth curve model confirm the existence of different impacts of urban functions on visitors' and residents'
attractiveness. Cultural dynamics appears to be a major determinant for attracting new residents and supporting
a strong international tourism industry. From an economic perspective, purely economic strength (in terms of
absolute growth) appears to enhance city attractiveness for residents, while the dynamics observed in research
and development activities influences the quality of employment instead of being a direct driver of population
growth. While the social aspects of sustainability (framed under the concept of livability) and the urban environment
typically exert higher impacts on urban attractiveness, accessibility appears mostly relevant for
visitors. Our analysis suggests an uneasy balance between livability, environment, and population and visitor
volume and growth. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The European Union promotes the paradigm of ecological modernization and the effectiveness of eco-innovations
(European Environment Agency, 2014). This is evident, in particular, from the political and financial
support that the Institution is devoting to smart cities. Thus far, most of the ‘smart’ projects developed in
European cities focus on the theme of the environment and its efficient management (European Union, 2014).
However, what has not yet been adequately investigated is the issue of the social impact of these smart
environmental projects (Beretta, 2014a, b, c). In particular, what seems important is the question of whether the
projects with environmental objectives also yield beneficial results from the social point of view, with special
reference to the issue of social inclusion. Who are the real beneficiaries of the projects of eco-innovation? Do the
benefits extend to all citizens or are they likely to go to only some sectors of the population, often the wealthier
ones, risking - among other things - promotion of the phenomenon of eco-gentrification? In more general terms,
can we say that smart cities represent the ‘ideal’ settings for the achievement of simultaneous environmental,
economic and social development?
This paper reports results from research conducted on smart environmental projects implemented in Italy and
posted on the national web platform italiansmart city.it. The project consisted in a qualitative analysis of the
environmental projects presented, in order to analyze their social impacts, especially referring to the question of
social inclusiveness and the risk of eco-gentrification. More generally, the analysis helps clarify whether the eco
-innovations represent an effective tool for achieving sustainable development in the Italian context.
Having said that, it cannot be assumed that readers are familiar with the European and Italian contexts. Par. 1
opens with a table that gives definitions of terms which are potentially not clear. It then shows ways that the
European Union is institutionalizing eco-innovation and smart cities, remaining on the latest debate on them.
Par. 2 highlights the risk of the technological rut the European Union is falling into; par. 3 illustrates the main
results of research carried out on the smart cities in the Lombardy Region regarding the social effects of ecoinnovations;
par. 4 attempts to draw a provisional conclusion. </td>

politics of measuring cities </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2017 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> As part of the post-2015 United Nations sustainable development agenda, the world has its first urban
sustainable development goal (USDG) “to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and
sustainable”. This paper provides an overview of the USDG and explores some of the difficulties around
using this goal as a tool for improving cities. We argue that challenges emerge around selecting the indicators
in the first place and also around the practical use of these indicators once selected. Three main practical
problems of indicator use include 1) the poor availability of standardized, open and comparable data 2) the
lack of strong data collection institutions at the city scale to support monitoring for the USDG and 3) “localization”
- the uptake and context specific application of the goal by diverse actors in widely different cities.
Adding to the complexity, the USDG conversation is taking place at the same time as the proliferation of a
bewildering array of indicator systems at different scales. Prompted by technological change, debates on
the “data revolution” and “smart city” also have direct bearing on the USDG. We argue that despite these
many complexities and challenges, the USDG framework has the potential to encourage and guide needed reforms
in our cities but only if anchored in local institutions and initiatives informed by open, inclusive and
contextually sensitive data collection and monitoring. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2017 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In recent decades, our cities are increasingly expected to become more sustainable urban forms, with many
added determinants. A multitude of city concepts has therefore been contrived. The most time-honored and
prominent concept is the “sustainable city,” which is depicted as a model urban form and thereafter more city
concepts have come into being. However, it is not clear for all the concepts, for instance, “eco-cities,” “smart
city,” “sustainable city,” and “resilient city,” what are the underpinning building blocks within each concept
and how these concepts correlate with each other. This bibliometric study organizes this in conducting a descriptive
summary, a clustering analysis, and multidimensional scaling of major city concepts, by establishing a coword
matrix of high-frequency keywords occurring in the Science Citations Index (SCI) and Social Science Citations
Index (SSCI) databases. In addition to summarizing the evolution of these concepts, it analyzes the composition
of each city concept and the core issues addressed by each city type. Also investigated are the correlations
between the city concepts with a statistical analysis of the clusters of literature in one concept that overlap or
connect to other clusters in another. From this, it is shown that, under the two umbrella terms of “sustainable
city” and “smart city,” the “? -city” literature has developed in a variety of distinctive ways. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The convergence of technology and the city is commonly referred to as the ‘smart city’. It is seen as a possible
remedy for the challenges that urbanisation creates in the age of global climate change, and as an enabler of a
sustainable and liveable urban future. A review of the abundant but fragmented literature on smart city theories
and practices, nevertheless, reveals that there is a limited effort to capture a comprehensive understanding on
how the complex and multidimensional nature of the drivers of smart cities are linked to desired outcomes. The
paper aims to develop a clearer understanding on this new city model by identifying and linking the key drivers
to desired outcomes, and then intertwining them in a multidimensional framework. The methodological approach
of this research includes a systematic review of the literature on smart cities, focusing on those aimed at
conceptual development and provide empirical evidence base. The review identifies that the literature reveals
three types of drivers of smart cities—community, technology, policy—which are linked to five desired outcomes—
productivity, sustainability, accessibility, wellbeing, liveability, governance. These drivers and outcomes
altogether assemble a smart city framework, where each of them represents a distinctive dimension of the
smart cities notion. This paper helps in expanding our understanding beyond a monocentric technology focus of
the current common smart city practice. </td>

methodologies for cities to show the progress towards defined targets. In the 21st century, there has been a
shift from sustainability assessment to smart city goals. We analyze 16 sets of city assessment frameworks (eight
smart city and eight urban sustainability assessment frameworks) comprising 958 indicators altogether by dividing
the indicators under three impact categories and 12 sectors. The following main observations derive from the
analyses: as expected, there is a much stronger focus on modern technologies and “smartness” in the smart city
frameworks compared to urban sustainability frameworks. Another observation is that as urban sustainability
frameworks contain a large number of indicators measuring environmental sustainability, smart city frameworks
lack environmental indicators while highlighting social and economic aspects. A general goal of smart cities is to
improve sustainability with help of technologies. Thus, we recommend the use of a more accurate term “smart
sustainable cities” instead of smart cities. However, the current large gap between smart city and sustainable
city frameworks suggest that there is a need for developing smart city frameworks further or re-defining the
smart city concept. We recommend that the assessment of smart city performance should not only use output
indicators that measure the efficiency of deployment of smart solutions but also impact indicators that measure
the contribution towards the ultimate goals such as environmental, economic or social sustainability. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The smart city encompasses a broad range of technological innovations which might be
applied to any city for a wide variety of reasons. In this article, I make a distinction
between local efforts to reshape the urban landscape, and a global smart city imaginary
which those efforts draw upon and help sustain. While attention has been given to the
malleability of the smart city concept at this global scale, there remains little effort to
interrogate the way that the future is used to sanction specific solutions. Through a
critical engagement with smart city marketing materials, industry documents, and consultancy
reports, I explore how the future is recruited, rearranged, and represented as a
rationalization for technological intervention in the present. This is performed amidst
three recurring crises: massive demographic shifts and subsequent resource pressures,
global climate change, and the conflicting demands of fiscal austerity that motivate the
desire of so many cities to attract foreign direct investment and highly skilled workers. In
revealing how crises are pre-empted, precautioned, and prepared for, I argue that the
smart city imaginary normalizes a style and scale of response deemed appropriate under
liberal capitalism. </td>

focuses on capturing and understanding a still evolving
movement called platform urbanism, which is centered around the
growing presence and power of digital platforms in cities. This
different mixture of capital-technology-cities tends to be more
directly connected to consumers, more intent on rapid scaling,
and more antagonistic to governments and incumbent industries.
This series lays out how the emergence of platform urbanism is
already provoking serious issues related to the oversight, operation,

   <td style="text-align:left;"> San Francisco is now widely considered to be the most important city in the world for
the location of new technology start-up firms, especially high valuation “unicorns,”
and is increasingly seen as both a locational and metaphorical extension of Silicon
Valley. In this paper, I trace some of the political strategies and tensions that have
accompanied the city’s prominence in this area, and in particular the distinctive role
of technology and venture capital in the political economy of urban development. The
paper has four empirical sections. It describes (1) the political machinations surrounding
the 2011 and 2015 municipal elections, which saw the election of Ed Lee
as Mayor with significant support from individual technology investors such as Ron
Conway and Marc Benioff, and accompanied by various “tech-friendly” policy shifts;
(2) the foundation of the “tech chamber of commerce” sf.citi as a means of enhancing
the policy influence of the tech industry in San Francisco; (3) the introduction of a
low taxation regime in the city’s Central Market area that has attracted technology
companies such as Twitter as tenants; and (4) the urban policy tensions associated
with the evolution of new “sharing economy” firms such as Uber and Airbnb, which
have aggressively challenged municipal regulations in the taxi and property rental
fields. Throughout these machinations, we can see a reshaping of capital fractions,
with venture and angel capital increasingly involved in reengineering the labor,
housing, and public transport markets of the city in order to circumvent the accumulation
problems that tech investors had suffered in the earlier dot.com failures. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> India aspires to modernize through 100 smart cities and achieve
higher living standards. They are projected as planned models for
other cities to emulate and position themselves as growth
engines. The government has devised specific criteria for smart
cities and encourages intra-city competition and cooperation with
private partners. This paper argues that the 100 smart cities strategy
reduces cities to a neoliberal commodity, through which
improving living standards and reaching sustainability goals are
seen through the narrow lens of economic growth parameters,
resulting in urban privatization. I suggest that this weakens the
democratically elected governance process, leading to splintered
infrastructure development that benefits the wealthy, further marginalizing
the poor. Drawing on field research, I demonstrate that
despite the aims of addressing India’s urban challenges through
the Smart Cities Mission, it has embraced neoliberal and entrepreneurial
urbanism, value creation, and profiting from the city, while
reducing the role of municipalities, residents, and democratic
stakeholders. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Investment in the release of open data has become increasingly central to the

originally arising out of a push towards “open government” and the pursuit of more
transparent decision-making by public authorities at multiple scales, open data programs
have more recently been adopted by municipal governments to support entrepreneurial
goals of enhanced competitive positioning and attracting investment. As
urban scholars now subject the smart city project to critical scrutiny for its role in
advancing urban entrepreneurialism, this article considers the relevance of the open
data agenda as it shapes wider understandings of the smart city. In particular, I
address the collection of policy practices, aspirations, stakeholders and entrepreneurs
active in framing the opportunities and values of open data for urban governments.
Both the momentum of support for open data, along with a recent shift in the
rhetorical aspirations of the open data movement away from the values of openness
and transparency and towards a more confined focus on value generation, raise
important critical questions for urban geographers concerned with the nature of

surveillance in Amsterdam Smart City. Based on a series of focus
groups, we show how people understand new forms of hypervisbility,
what strategies they use to navigate these experiences, and what
the limitations of these strategies are. We show how people tried to
discern between public and private sector actors, to differentiate who
they trusted by building on the existing social contract. People also
trusted the objectivity of data in relation to prior experiences of social
contexts and discrimination. Lastly, we show how the experiences of
some of the inhabitants in our study who were most vulnerable to
hypervisibility highlight the limits to strategies based on the neutrality
of data. By asking about perceived surveillance rather than
emphasising actual practices of surveilling, we show differentiated
contexts and strategies, providing empirical grounds to question the

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Data, how we conceptualize them, who uses them, and how they are
used, are central to current questions about smart cities and critical
data studies. This article develops a conceptual framework, rhizomatic
data assemblages, to better understand how data-driven mapping
practices call out, problematize, and attempt to change the social
relations of housing in American cities. Kitchin and Lauriault outline
the concept of data assemblages as an approach to how the production
of data and social processes are interrelated. This paper employs
that concept through a reading of Deleuze and Guattari’s writings on
assemblage and of counter-mapping to emphasize the dynamic, creative,
alternative social possibilities that data can help open. Two cases,
the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project and Inside Airbnb, show how housing
data can be produced and used in radically different ways than
facilitating real estate transactions. </td>

point of large-scale and ambitious technology-driven city making
processes and ambitions. In this study, we draw upon observations,
interviews, and policy analysis to examine processes of city making
and the spread of ICT-driven infrastructures, juxtaposing ambitious
visions of emergent plans with ordinary realities of the African city.
We demonstrate that while processes of smart city making have
strongly been inclined toward technocratic approaches and deterministic
appeals, this inclination is highly deceptive. We argue that
rather than being deterministic, these processes are essentially
politicized, highly contested, and shaped by the role and impact
of local practices and context-specific realities. In making this argument,
we draw from a social studies of technology perspective
which engages with the notion of technological determinism to
make this contribution to the academic field of critical urbanism. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In the heyday of the late 2000s financial crisis, austerity urbanism became a dominant
practice of state financial restructuring—an intensification in the encroachment of the
neoliberal project into the agendas of local governments. In the specific case of Italy,
which faced political and economic distress between 2011 and 2013, “smart city”
policies became one of the foundational political technologies for the implementation
of austerity measures. In this paper, I analyse how the smart city provided a lexicon for
urban austerity through a series of different sites and vehicles of policymaking, from
practitioners to companies and other institutions. I argue that smart city discourses and
practices functioned as a political technology that was effective in justifying cost
containment measures and supporting the shift to pro-innovation public expenditures.
Yet, at the same time, the smart city techno-utopian vocabulary created spaces where
other meanings and, potentially, alternative political outcomes were made possible by
diverse alignments of knowledge and expertise. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article focuses on the development of the Czechoslovak ‘rychlá tramvaj’ (‘fast tram’) systems in Prague,
Bratislava and Brno. Its aim is to examine whether these systems meet the requirements of light rail and whether
it is possible to continue their development as a functional light rail city transport system. A further aim is a detailed
analysis of the conditions and contexts affecting the gradual development of ‘rychlá tramvaj’ schemes in
three selected metropolises in the former Czechoslovakia.
Urban development in Czechoslovakia was affected by the socialist planning system that constructed large housing
estates on the edges of metropolises during the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, many commuters had to be moved
between them and city centres daily; therefore, the necessity for high-capacity ‘rychlá tramvaj’ connections became
apparent. After socio-political changes in 1989, a market economy was introduced and the trends of commercial
and residential suburbanization have modified the spatial structure of the cities, and mobility has begun to be
increasingly dependent on cars. In response to this, city councils departed from further development of ‘rychlá
tramvaj’ schemes. Currently, the emphasis on sustainable mobility is apparent, principally because of smart city solutions,
an environmental focus and a common European transport policy; thus, municipalities are rediscovering
the virtues of light rail lines again. Because the ‘rychlá tramvaj’ systems fromthe 1970s and 1980s are still in operation,
transforming them into modern light rail systems appears to be a convenient and cheap solution. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Over the last few years, nexus-thinking has become a buzzword in urban research and practice.
This also applies to recent claims of greater integration or coordination of urban infrastructures
that have traditionally been managed separately and have been unbundled. The idea is to better
address their growing sociotechnical complexity, their externalities and their operation within an
urban system of systems. This article introduces a collection of case studies aimed at critically
appraising how concepts of nexus and infrastructure integration have become guiding visions for
the development of green, resilient or smart cities. It assesses how concepts of nexus and calls for
higher interconnectivity and ‘co-management’ within and across infrastructure domains often forestall
more politically informed discussions and downplay potential risks and institutional restrictions.
Based on an urban political and sociotechnical approach, the introduction to this special
issue centres around four major research gaps: 1) the tensions between calls for infrastructure rebundling
and the urban trends and realities driven by infrastructure restructuring since the 1990s;
2) the existing boundary work in cities and urban stakeholders’ practices in bringing fragmented
urban infrastructures together; 3) the politics involved in infrastructural and urban change and in
aligning urban infrastructures that often defy managerial rhetoric of resource efficiency, smartness
and resilience; and 4) the spatialities at play in infrastructural reconfigurations that selectively promote
specific spaces and scales of metabolic autonomy, system operation (and failure), networked
interconnectivities and system regulation. We conclude by outlining directions for future research. </td>

Attention is also drawn to weakened capacity of urban governments to control their infrastructural
destiny and also constraints on the ability of the public and private sectors to innovate. The
paper contributes to smart city debates by providing further evidence of the difficulties in substantiating
the smart city imaginary. </td>

‘Smart City Regionalism’ Square the Circle? </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Tassilo Herrschel </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2013 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Increasingly, the widely established, globalisation-driven agenda of economic competitiveness
meets a growing concern with sustainability. Yet, the practical and conceptual
co-existence— or fusion —of these two agendas is not always easy. This
includes finding and operationalising the ‘right’ scale of governance, an important
question for the pursuit of the distinctly transscalar nature of these two policy fields.
‘New regionalism’ has increasingly been discussed as a pragmatic way of tackling the
variable spatialities associated with these policy fields and their changing articulation.
This paper introduces ‘smart (new) city-regionalism’, derived from the principles
of smart growth and new regionalism, as a policy-shaping mechanism and
analytical framework. It brings together the rationales, agreed principles and legitimacies
of publicly negotiated polity with collaborative, network-based and policy driven
spatiality. The notion of ‘smartness’, as suggested here as central feature, goes
beyond the implicit meaning of ‘smart’ as in ‘smart growth’. When introduced in
the later 1990s the term embraced a focus on planning and transport. Since then, the
adjective ‘smart’ has become used ever more widely, advocating innovativeness, participation,
collaboration and co-ordination. The resulting ‘smart city regionalism’ is
circumscribed by the interface between the sectorality and territoriality of policy-making
processes. Using the examples of Vancouver and Seattle, the paper looks at
the effects of the resulting specific local conditions on adopting ‘smartness’ in the
scalar positioning of policy-making. </td>

Material and allegorical double
dispossession </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper studies the arrival of digital nomads in Cluj, Romania. I focus upon double dispossession,
in which ‘digital nomads’ allegorise technocapitalist fantasies by appropriating Roma identity
on one hand, and in which Roma are evicted to make way for the arrival of Western digital
nomads and tech firms on the other. While Roma are materially dispossessed as Cluj siliconises,
they are doubly dispossessed by the conjuration of the deracinated digital nomad/Gypsy. As I suggest,
this figure discursively drags with it onto-epistemological residues of 19th-century
Orientalism – a literary genre that emerged within the heart of Western European empires. The
recoding of the nomad today, I argue, indexes the imperiality of technocapitalism, or technoimperialism.
Double dispossession, as a phenomenon, illuminates that prior histories bolster, and
are consumed by, globalising techno-imperialism. Postcolonial and postsocialist studies offer
frameworks for understanding this update, as well as the accumulative and multifaceted dispossession
that siliconisation inheres. I thus argue for a connected rather than comparative approach
in understanding double dispossession, one focused upon connections across time, space and
genre. A connected approach remains rooted in community organising and housing justice
struggles. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article examines the evolution of the ‘Barcelona Model’ of urban transformation through the
lenses of worlding and provincialising urbanism. We trace this evolution from an especially dogmatic
worlding vision of the smart city, under a centre-right city council, to its radical repurposing
under the auspices of a municipal government led, after May 2015, by the citizens’ platform
Barcelona en Comu´. We pay particular attention to the new council’s objectives to harness digital
platform technologies to enhance participative democracy, and its agenda to secure technological
sovereignty and digital rights for its citizens. While stressing the progressive intent of these aims,
we also acknowledge the challenge of going beyond the repurposing of smart technologies so as
to engender new and radical forms of subjectivity among citizens themselves; a necessary basis
for any urban revolution. </td>

junctions in urban sustainability
transitions: The case of hot
water metering </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Harald Rohracher, Helena Ko¨ hler </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The integration of infrastructure domains and resource flows such as electricity, heat, water and
waste increasingly gains currency in strategies to achieve more resource-efficient, smart and resilient
cities. While widely discussed concepts of a nexus of resource systems, such as energy–water–food,
aim at a more optimised and integrative management of resource flows, this article investigates how
infrastructure integration is accomplished through the establishment of new interfaces and junctions
between formerly separated systems. In particular, it focuses on households as an arena where different
urban infrastructures intersect and different kinds of sometimes contradicting demands are
imposed to co-manage these infrastructures, such as in the case of own electricity generation from
photovoltaics along with the charging of electric cars and the management of household energy consumption.
The installation of meters and the constant monitoring of resource use and consumption
feedback to household members is regarded as a crucial element in such a transition towards more
sustainable urban infrastructures. Empirically, the article studies the introduction of hot tap water
meters in urban households in Sweden and the resistance and reactions of these households to such
a metering regime. Our study shows how meters as new junctions between energy suppliers and
users but also between separate infrastructures of electricity, hot tap water and room heating
become contested political terrains which are linked to broader socio-political questions of urban
change. In contrast to system management perspectives, such an ‘inside-out’ approach rather lends
itself to context-sensitive and navigational governance approaches of infrastructure integration. </td>

Skills and the occupational
evolution of British cities </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Peter Sunley, Ron Martin, Ben Gardiner </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2020 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Recent research has argued that human capital has become the key driver of city growth and that
there is a widening divergence between high- and low-skill cities. This skilled-city view includes several
stylised propositions. The first is that more skills and human capital generate stronger economic
growth; the second is that already-skilled cities are becoming ever more skilled; and, the
third is that larger cities tend to have stronger concentrations of, and faster growth in, high-skilled,
cognitive occupations. Using a detailed data set for occupational change in 85 urban Travel to
Work Areas in Britain between 1981 and 2015, this paper evaluates whether these propositions
apply to British urban evolution, and how they relate to the ‘hollowing-out’ of medium-skilled jobs.
The results confirm the close interactive relationship between growth and high-skilled occupations.
However, some of the skilled-city propositions, such as ‘smart cities becoming smarter’, and
a positive relationship between agglomeration and high-skilled employment growth, do not apply
in Britain where other factors have been more important. The pattern of high-skill growth has
shown a strong regional dimension, and the ‘emergence’ of newer smaller cities, particularly in
southern England, has been more evident than the ‘resurgence’ of large core and industrial cities. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The smart city has been both celebrated for opening up decision-making processes through
responsive digital infrastructures, and criticised for turning citizens into mere nodes of sociotechnical
networks under corporate or government control. In line with these depictions, smart
city politics is often analysed as a struggle between aspirations for bottom-up participatory
democracy and authoritarian control. Drawing on ethnographic research on an Amsterdam project
which encourages citizens to collect and share air quality data, we problematise this vertical
reading of smart city politics. The project mobilises both republican citizenship and cybernetic
citizenship, each assuming different logics regarding the ways in which citizens negotiate urban life
by means of data and sensing technologies. While republican citizenship emphasises citizens’
sovereignty, cybernetic citizenship emphasises their immersion into informational environments.
We demonstrate how, depending on specific situated interests and forms of engagement, both
kinds of citizenship feed into appealing visions of urban life for different actors. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Of the build out of humanity predicted up to the end of the century, a substantial portion will
occur within informal urban settlements – areas characterised by poor access to infrastructure
and services. There is a pressing need to better understand how and with what implications the
growing proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, as a component of smart urbanism,
are being applied to address the challenges of these areas. The following paper addresses this
research gap, showing how IoT technology is reconfiguring trust within water and energy infrastructures
in Nairobi. We apply work on informal urban infrastructures and smart urbanism to
three case studies, producing novel insights into how IoT technologies reconfigure connections
between users, providers and infrastructures. This reconfiguration of trust smooths chronic infrastructural
uncertainties and generates reliability within informal settlements and, in doing so, leads
to increased personal economies. We conclude by considering how these examples provide
insights into the implications of IoT for everyday urbanisms in informal settlements and how these
insights relate to global smart city debates more widely. </td>

firm locations at the level of individual addresses allows us to describe the knowledge environment

places with higher numbers of same-sector firms, more start-ups and a higher inflow of other
firms. They also locate in closer proximity to universities and research institutes. These differences
decay rapidly within a few metres (50–250 m), indicating a truly microgeographic scope of

Socio-technical experimentation in

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A growing body of literature has emerged that examines cities as key sites for socio-technical
experimentation with a variety of initiatives and interventions to reduce carbon emissions,
upgrade ageing infrastructure networks and stimulate economic development. Yet while there has
been a wide survey of global initiatives and attempts to explain the wider processes driving such
experimentation (Bulkeley and Casta´n Broto, 2013) there remains a lack of empirical case study
analysis to bring the concepts into context. In this paper we use the concept of urban experimentation
as a lens to discuss the political and social ramifications of one such intervention in a city’s
energy infrastructure network, with an examination of the Pecan Street smart grid project in
Austin, Texas. The ability for cities to manage socio-technical transitions and their inflections by
specific locales has been largely neglected in social science research, yet cities around the world
are facing similar problems of ageing infrastructures, pressures of resource consumption and
demanding shifts towards intermittent renewable technologies. We argue that cities are key arenas
for the trialling, testing and development of smart products that can help transition towards a
low-carbon economy, however the ‘opening up’ of cities as experimental nodes is contributing to
a restructuring in socio-technical urban governance, creating new spaces for private investment
while delegating responsibilities for carbon control down to urban citizens. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The ‘sharing economy’ has become a new buzzword in urban life as digital technology companies set
up online platforms to link together people and un- or underutilised assets with those seeking to
rent them for short periods of time. While cloaked under the rhetoric of ‘sharing’, the exchanges
they foster are usually profit-driven. These economic activities are having profound impacts on urban
environments as they disrupt traditional forms of hospitality, transport, service industry and housing.
While critical debates have focused on the challenges that sharing economy activities bring to existing
labour and economic practices, it is necessary to acknowledge that they also have increasingly significant
impacts on planning policy and urban governance. Using the case of Airbnb in London, this
article looks at how these sharing or platform economy companies are involved in encouraging governments
to change existing regulations, in this case by deregulating short-term letting. This has
important implications for planning enforcement. We examine how the challenges around obtaining
data to enforce new regulations are being addressed by local councils who struggle to balance corporate
interests with public good. Finally, we address proposals for using algorithms and big data as
means of urban governance and argue that the schism between regulation and enforcement is opening
up new digitally mediated spaces of informal practices in cities. </td>

adopted by planners, managers and politicians around the world in an attempt to position
their cities in the fierce competition for revenue, jobs and people. In this paper we will concentrate
on gaining an understanding of informational territories built to support surveillance and
control of public spaces. We seek to question this relation by making reference to several specific
uses of information and communication technologies for surveillance purposes and to discuss it
from the point of view of definitions of territory. Our goal is to discuss the fact that, under the
‘mantra’ of smarter cities and on the grounds of public security, there is a scattering of micro and

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Amidst the hype of a ‘new’ energy regime in India with a singular focus on renewable energy, this
paper offers a more scrupulous reading of renewables to set up a critical energy discourse. It
offers a three-part analysis where it begins by questioning the entrenched idea of ‘renewables as
science’ and its instrumental use of metrics and measurements to convey an unbelievable reach
and significance. Highlighting the consistent invocation of a calculative ethos, it shows how an
‘empirics of targets’ relying largely on the lure and lore of a single numeric, installed capacity, is
persuasively employed to gloss over the crucial distinction between the potential and reality of
renewables. An associated consequence is not only its pegging to the speculative value of marketbased
energy production but also that it remains rooted in the assumptions of an existing system,
that is, the logic of a carbon lifeworld. Renewables, as a result, display the tell-tale sign of a sustainability
paradox, raising questions about their ability to master a transition to a post-fossil performativity,
exasperated as they are by internal contradictions embedded within their core
characteristics – efficiency/sufficiency and, more importantly, tensions between utilities and infrastructure.
With loose connections to parallel initiatives such as the Smart Cities Mission, the
transformative potential of renewables is undercut as it remains embedded within an abstract grid
imaginary, challenging any effort to actualise it in and through the urban. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A defining feature of planning is that it is informed by sound evidence. An ever more diverse
range of decision support tools is available to help achieve this, a trend that is set to accelerate
along with the rise of Big Data and Smart Cities. At the same time, planning is frequently
requested to improve the urban and environmental outcomes it helps deliver. This research
draws upon intellectual resources from Science and Technology Studies, and empirical data
from actors across the science–policy–practice interface, to analyse critically issues connected
to the design, application and wider effects of calculative practices within planning. It finds that
these practices selectively open up or foreclose discourses and play important political roles
relating to ordering complexity and mitigating professional risk. They are also revealed as
underpinning a stability and certainty within decision making that not only maintains the power
of established calculative agencies but also serves to replicate an ideology of urban form that is
in tension with more normative calls for change. More broadly, the findings help unsettle the
planner and planning policy as the key agent able to change planning outcomes, which is
instead revealed as more contingent on the political, institutional and professional culture, and
the ways human and non-human objects align and combine to create internal stability when
there are external calls for change. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Notions of the smart city are pervasive in urban development discourses. Various frameworks
for the development of smart cities, often conceptualised as roadmaps, make a number of implicit
claims about how smart city projects proceed but the legitimacy of those claims is unclear. This
paper begins to address this gap in knowledge. We explore the development of a smart transport
application, MotionMap, in the context of a £16M smart city programme taking place in Milton
Keynes, UK. We examine how the idealised smart city narrative was locally inflected, and discuss
the differences between the narrative and the processes and outcomes observed in Milton
Keynes. The research shows that the vision of data-driven efficiency outlined in the roadmaps is
not universally compelling, and that different approaches to the sensing and optimisation of urban
flows have potential for empowering or disempowering different actors. Roadmaps tend to
emphasise the importance of delivering quick practical results. However, the benefits observed in
Milton Keynes did not come from quick technical fixes but from a smart city narrative that reinforced
existing city branding, mobilising a growing network of actors towards the development of
a smart region. Further research is needed to investigate this and other smart city developments,
the significance of different smart city narratives, and how power relationships are reinforced and
constructed through them. </td>

drawing on the case of Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative. Using the case studies of the smart home

by the neoliberal-developmental logics of the state, thereby facilitating authoritarian consolidation in
Singapore. As such, this paper distinguishes itself from previous works on the neoliberal smart city by
situated smart urbanism within the socio-political dynamics of neoliberalism-as-developmental strategy.

the power/knowledge implications for the contemporary city. On the one hand,
smart city policies support new ways of imagining, organising and managing the city
and its flows; on the other, they impress a new moral order on the city by introducing
specific technical parameters in order to distinguish between the ‘good’ and
‘bad’ city. The smart city discourse may therefore be a powerful tool for the production
of docile subjects and mechanisms of political legitimisation. The paper is
largely based on theoretical reflections and uses smart city politics in Italy as a case
study. The paper analyses how the smart city discourse proposed by the European
Union has been reclassified to produce new visions of the ‘good city’ and the role of

they are understood as a videological type of Leibniz’s concept of the windowless monad.
Secondly, they are conceptualised as examples of banal and serialised architecture. Thirdly, these

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Studies of ‘smart cities’ in Canada primarily focus on large cities but not small, rural and remote
communities. As a result, we have a limited understanding of the incentive structures for smaller,
remote and rural communities to pursue smart city development. This knowledge deficit is concerning,
since the introduction of technology can hold a number of unique benefits for these
communities, including easier connections to the rest of Canada and large urban centres, reputation
building, improved service delivery and enhanced opportunities for residents. Drawing upon
localised forms of knowledge creation, policy development theories, adoption and local competition
literature and primary interviews with private and public officials, we examine the challenges
and opportunities of ‘smart city’ implementation through case studies of small and rural municipalities
in Annapolis Valley in Nova Scotia and a remote community, Iqaluit, Nunavut. We find that
collaboration is essential for rural and remote pursuit of smart city development and is necessary
to counteract the limitations of capacity, scale and digital divides. Challenges aside, however, the
primary rationale for adoption of smart city technology remains the same regardless of size:
enhanced quality of life for residents and sustained community health. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Recently, the explosive growth of ridesourcing, or on-demand ridesharing, has attracted a great
deal of attention from researchers and planners. Despite its transformative impacts on mobility,
limited studies have examined how built environment affects its use. In this study, we investigate
the impacts of built environment on ridesourcing demand. We employ structural equation modelling
to account for the complex relationships among study variables, and investigate the impacts
at census block group level by using RideAustin data in Austin, Texas. Findings reveal strong
impacts of built environment on ridesourcing demand and significant temporal heterogeneity. The
models show that greater population/employment/service job densities, road density, pavement
completeness, land use mix and job accessibility by transit produce more ridesourcing demand.
Access to the commuter rail (MetroRail) also leads to greater demand. Furthermore, time-of-day
(TOD) models demonstrate that these effects vary significantly according to the time of day. Our
research has implications for policy making and for travel demand modelling of ridesourcing. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> As a prominent and performative discourse, The Smart City has the potential to shape urban
futures. Yet, its mostly top-down implementation and dominantly technocratic definition of problems
raises critiques of The Smart City as the latest version of a series of post-political and neoliberal
visions of urban governance. However, as smart cities are implemented into ‘actually existing’
strategies locally, they are always negotiated and translated into place-specific contexts. Beyond
critiquing the powerful discourse of The Smart City, the social innovation–(re)politicisation nexus
(SIRN) spells out a framework for contesting and co-producing radically transformative smart city
visions and politics as they take shape on the ground. Linking the empirical case study of the ‘topdown’
implementation of SmartCity Cologne, Germany, to current ‘bottom-up’ discourses on
reclaiming the urban commons, we show how ‘true’ and ‘real’ social innovation must go hand-inhand
with a re-politicisation of hegemonic logics and discursive framings. In doing so, this paper
makes theoretical and empirical contributions to public and academic discourse on which governance
practices, methods and policies could contribute to radical transformations towards a ‘truly’
smart and sustainable urban future. </td>

threefold: (1) to assess the normative aspirations and limitations of policy makers and key actors
in the municipality with regard to the smart resident idea, with a focus on participation and privacy;
(2) to assess and categorise levels of participation in varied social and geographic contexts
in the city; and (3) to assess the possible link between participation and privacy practices among
users. Empirically, this paper studies the practices of the inhabitants of Tel Aviv-Yafo City, with a
focus on the use of digitised services provided by the municipality and the use of the celebrated
project ‘Digi-Tel’ – a digital card that offers to the inhabitants of the city services, discounts, targeted
information and benefits around the city. The assessment of the inhabitants’ practices is
based on a survey that was conducted in four neighbourhoods with different socio-economic,
ethnic and geographical characteristics. The survey is supplemented with interviews of prominent
figures in the Tel Aviv-Yafo municipality to understand their views on participation and privacy.
The paper concludes with a discussion of the varied profiles of the users and non-users of digital

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Nowadays, most people carry around a powerful smartphone which is well suited to constantly monitor the
location and sometimes even the activity of its user. This makes tracking prevalent and leads to a large number of
projects concerned with trajectory data. One area of particular interest is transport and mobility, where data is
important for urban planning and smart city-related activities, but can also be used to provide individual users
with feedback and suggestions for personal behavior change. As part of a large-scale study based in Switzerland,
we use activity tracking data to provide people with eco-feedback on their own mobility patterns and stimulate
them to adopt more energy-efficient mobility choices. In this paper we explore the opportunities offered by
smartphone based activity tracking, propose a general framework to exploit location data to foster more sustainable
mobility behavior, describe the technical solutions chosen and discuss a range of outcomes in terms of
user perception and sustainability potential. The presented approach extracts mobility patterns from users’
trajectories, computes credible alternative transport options, and presents the results in a concise and clear way.
The resulting eco-feedback helps people to understand their mobility choices, discover the most non-ecological
parts of their travel behavior, and explore feasible alternatives. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The sustainable governance of transport systems remains a significant challenge for policy makers worldwide,
particularly in cities. Urban areas are developing rapidly from a technological viewpoint, and innovative technologies
create new possibilities for smart mobility management. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship
between the implementation of the smart city concept and the idea of sustainable transport, particularly
with regard to the reduction of transport generated CO2 emissions. The study estimates CO2 emissions for
different potential scenarios of development for the Warsaw transport system until 2050 using the United Nations'
ForFITS (For Future Inland Transport Systems) model. The study also analyses the additional impact on CO2
emissions of smart city elements as determinants of mobility. The results show that meeting the reduction targets
set by the European Union 2011 White Paper on Transport will be challenging, requiring an in-depth transformation
of the transport and energy sectors. This study also confirms that smart city solutions can play a crucial
role in mitigating transport emissions and meeting reduction goals. The conclusions provide important insights for
the design of smart mobility governance and enhance the relationship between transport policy and research. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In an era where the notion of “smart” has entered almost every sector, including that of transport, it seems more
important than ever to preserve the real “smartness” of road networks, addressing the needs of all users, mainly
of the vulnerable ones, by means of new technologies in transport sector. The present work reveals the need for
designing “sustainably smart” instead of “smart” road networks, referring to the adoption of “smart” technologies
in the context of sustainable mobility. Aiming at highlighting problems due to improper or inefficient
implementation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in urban environment, the most crowded and congested
street of Thessaloniki (Greece) is studied. It is characterized by severe pedestrian delays and high imposed
pedestrian speed at crossings, due to ITS which ensure high priority of motorized traffic over pedestrians at
signalized intersections, thus improving vehicle travel times, but highly extending pedestrian waiting times and
minimizing green-man phase duration, resulting in significant loss of pedestrian man-hours and in increased
safety risk for them. The existing situation is assessed and proposals towards the implementation of the notion of
“sustainable intelligence” in a “smart” urban road network, turning it into a “sustainably smart” urban road
network, are made. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Traffic congestion continues to be the bane of many metropolitan areas and has exercised the minds of experts for
at least the last 60 years. With the advent of smart (intelligent) mobility, aligned with digital disruption and future
connected and collaborative transport including extensions to autonomous vehicles, the question of whether we
have a new window of opportunity to tame congestion is now high on the list of possibilities. It is however very
unclear what the future will look like in respect of congestion on the roads, especially if we rely on ‘smart’
technology and continue to reject reform of road user charging and new opportunities to fund the sharing model.
This paper looks at a number of themes as a way of highlighting possibilities and challenges and promotes a
position that congestion may not be reduced, especially without a significant switch to the sharing economy and
relinquishing of private car ownership; the urgent need for government to define the institutional setting within
which smart mobility can deliver reductions in congestion; and the crucial role that road pricing reform must play
to ensure that those who benefit (suppliers and travellers) contribute to pay for the infrastructure (in particular)
that they gain benefit from. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> After the approval and implementation of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP) in different cities of Spain,
the evolution and the level of development of each one are still unknown. In fact, as many of them were
approved before 2010, they didn't include a precise methodology for the further analysis of the proposed and/or
implemented mobility measures. So, this evaluation of the mobility plans, their results and the comparison
between cities and their evolution towards a more sustainable mobility represents nowadays a challenge in many
cases.
In 2011, the Spanish Law for a Sustainable Economy (Law 2/2011) was approved, which encouraged local
administrations to create a SUMP. The approval of a SUMP was compulsory to local authorities to get any public
funding for public transport projects. The main objectives of these plans were not only the reduction of the urban
congestion and pollution, but also to encourage the citizens to change their habits so they are less car-dependent
and more active in their daily trips. However, it is still necessary an evaluation to confirm that these SUMPs have
represented a substantial change in terms of logistics and management of the transports and vehicles, both
private and public, as well as of behaviour and habits of the citizens.
The main objective of this paper is to show the results of a research conducted on 38 Sustainable Urban
Mobility Plans. The cities are all members of the Spanish Network of Smart Cities (Red Española de Ciudades
Inteligentes -RECI-).
The SUMPs are analysed, addressing the identification and evaluation of the different specifically proposed
mobility measures included in plans, the degree of definition of them, the costs, the implementation programs,
etc. Also, follow-up programs were discussed.
First, an analysis was made of the diagnosis of the mobility situation in each location according to the diagnosis
document included in many of the SUMPs. The second stage consisted on the analysis of the measures in
the plan, considering sixteen indicators, such as accessibility, intermodality, pedestrians or design of public
space. Finally, it was also determined whether the document included a monitoring plan, a budget and a
timeline.
Through the comparison of the results, we obtain a brief overview about the evolution of efforts to get a more
sustainable mobility in Spain. With these results, we finish our study proposing some guidelines for further
analysis as well as for the new SUMPs that will be approved on the following years. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The increasing rate of urban population and deteriorating conditions of physical, institutional, social, and
economic infrastructure in cities are demanding smarter ways to improve public utilities and services in India.
Smart city development promotes an established, interconnected, and sustainable urban system. The Indian
government has launched “100 Smart Cities Mission” for planned urbanization in the country. The “100 cities”
have been selected from a two-round city challenge competition. However, some controversial viewpoints have
made questionable remarks over the selection process. For the effective planning of smart cities, an exhaustive
analysis is essential to find the existing critical infrastructure, key resources, and development trends. The
purpose of this study is to aid city planners and decision-makers to determine city eligibility in a multidimensional
way and to develop evaluation criteria for city selection process to meet the goal of smart city
mission. This article proposes a weighted criteria model to assess the city selection eligibility. The factors are
identified from the literature studies. Total interpretive structure modeling is used to analyze the complex interrelationships
among the factors and to develop a selection hierarchy. The fuzzy MICMAC process is used to
classify the factors based on driving power and dependence. The stabilized driving power is applied to calculate
the corresponding weights for each factor. In study findings, the most driving, linkage and dependent factors are
identified for analyzing city selection eligibility. The policy-makers, government officials, and decisions-makers
would get benefitted from the study outcomes to select top “N” number of cities for Smart Cities Mission. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This study addresses the strategic governance challenges of modern smart cities from the new viewpoint of big
data management. It seeks to develop and highlight a systematic methodological framework for handling
multivariate big data in a smart urban decision support context in the ‘New Urban World’, so as to enhance the
cities’ competitive performance through the design and development of operational urban management principles
and strategies. The specific aim of this paper is to provide the critical and basic cornerstones for an
applicable interactive dashboard architecture as a supporting tool in a structured process of innovative city
strategies and consequent enhanced socio-economic performance. A core element in the present paper is formed
by a smart urban dashboard system that acts as an interactive navigation tool supporting operational choices of
all stakeholders involved. This dashboard is able to integrate complex and ever-changing big data bases serving
as ‘signposts’ of city intelligence (or i-city smartness) for daily or strategic decisions of all urban stakeholders.
This study thus outlines successively the concept of smart i-cities in our ‘urban century’, the great potential of
digital technology for managing big data in governing i-cities, and the foundations of an urban dashboard on the
basis of the so-called Pentagon model as a policy strategy vehicle. Starting from extensive data on a broad set of
global cities, the potential of this approach is exemplified by means of an illustrative application of a smart urban
dashboard for the city of Stockholm. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Climate change and its impacts cannot be addressed once for all due to internal complexity. Some implemented
strategies may only be capable of dealing with a cluster of problems while leaving many others untouched. The
co-benefits approach, however, opens up a ‘window of opportunity’ via achieving multi-goals simultaneously.
Based on this, this paper aims to unpack the interrelationship between the struggling urban heat island (UHI)
issue and the already ongoing sponge city (SPC) projects in China. Specifically, the co-benefits are investigated
from technical, financial, institutional and social perspectives, after which pathways to implementation are
presented. In these aspects, the co-benefits approach can bring opportunities for implementing SPC and UHI
mitigation. The inclusion of UHI mitigation into SPC construction can enhance public participation and thereby
consolidate the public-private partnership model for funds. During the co-benefits approach implementation, the
weights of different authorities can be rebalanced to promote institutional transitions. SPC-derived UHI mitigation
approach, potentially realising synergies of urban flooding and UHI mitigation, can be a model for
countries which have already released low-impact development water management practices, and may also
provide references for other projects such as green building, low-carbon eco-city, smart city, forest city and haze
treatment for UHI mitigation. </td>

practices from the UK under the microscope to investigate their contributions in achieving sustainable urban
outcomes. Panel data analysis methods were employed to investigate changes in carbon dioxide emissions level
of 15 UK cities with differential level of city smartness over the period of 2005–2013. The findings reveal that the
link between city smartness and carbon dioxide emissions is not linear, and the impact of city smartness on
carbon dioxide emissions does not change over time. This finding calls for better aligning smart city strategies to

Our sample of 202 residents of a mid-sized Canadian city indicates that messages regarding the public benefits of increased density reduced NIMBYism by four times the control message.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The paper proposes and develops an original concept, dormant vehicles, which refers to vehicles that are stationary
while waiting to be used again, such as current parked cars. The concept involves several types of
vehicles (cars, bikes, vans, automated vehicles), durations, temporal locations and rates of recurrence that, with
the emergence of new mobility futures, would have diverse forms with significant implications for land use,
space and place. New forms of dormant vehicle include shared electric vehicles, dock-less bikes and delivery
vans that besides parking would present new in-between use situations such as dropping-off, picking-up, delivering,
charging and awaiting repair. The paper highlights that without thinking clearly about these aspects of
the future, plans for sustainable, smart cities could fall into a similar trap as in historical versions of automobility
and parking, that is, of overlooking dormant vehicles and the ways they shape and are shaped. Rather than
parking conveniently disappearing from cities, it is instead likely to change in various respects. The paper sets
out to put this research agenda at the forefront, drawing on social theories of practice to propose and develop
this new concept, highlighting its potential contribution to urban futures thinking. Ultimately, the paper argues
for inverting urban mobility futures to identify the new forms of dormant vehicles associated with them, and
consider their implications for land use, space and place. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Transforming urban areas into prosperous, liveable, and sustainable settlements is a longstanding goal for local
governments. Today, countless urban settlements across the globe have jumped into the so-called ‘smart city’
bandwagon to achieve this goal. Under the smart city agenda, presently, many government agencies are attempting
to engineer an urban transformation to tackle urban prosperity, liveability, and sustainability issues
mostly through the means of technology solutions. Nonetheless, the notion of smart cities is ambiguous, and
there are limited conceptual frameworks to assist cities and their administrations in understanding the big
picture view of this urban development paradigm. The aim of this paper is to generate a clear understanding on
the making of successful smart city practices. This is done by elaborating the smart cities notion through a
multidimensional conceptual framework, examining smart city best practices across the globe—i.e., Songdo,
Masdar, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Brisbane—, and providing insights of smart city approaches from these
cases. The findings of the study disclose the need for a comprehensive smart city conceptualisation to inform
policy making and consequently the practice. This will help in the formation of a much-needed smart urbanism
model for the resilient settlements of the climate emergency era. </td>

and growth projection pose a serious challenge for large cities for vulnerability. Amongst the several challenges,
food security will be a serious issue for the future of cities. In this context, the Fourth Industrial Revolution and

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sharing seems to experience a fashionable renaissance nowadays. It appears as though we are constantly involved
in sharing activities in our daily physical and digital lives. Images, feelings or thoughts are shared on
social media platforms; we share cars (e.g. Zipcar), bikes, homes and beds (e.g. Airbnb and Couchsurfing),
money and other resources (e.g. Wemakeit and Kickstarter). These different practices, their impact and adjoining
conceptual frameworks are controversially debated within the Smart City Debate and the Sharing Discourse (e.g.
tourism phenomena related to Airbnb). ‘Sharing’ emphasizes the utilization of underused resources and the shift
from owning things or goods to sharing them. So far, less attention has been paid to ‘new’ sharing models or
approaches in rural contexts. In this article we take a first step by mapping and comparing ‘cow sharing’ arrangements
within the European Alpine Region as one of such rural and digitally mediated formats of sharing
practices. 60 cow sharing arrangements in five countries (Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France, Italy) are
mapped and investigated through the lens of property rights (Schlager and Ostrom, 1992) and the sharing
paradigm. Farmers’ main motivation to enter sharing arrangements are the direct marketing of high-quality
products and the intensified social relations with tourists and consumers. The analysis of the cow sharing arrangements
shows two different types: (i) ‘authorized users’ and (ii) ‘withdrawal-focused crowding arrangements’,
that illustrate new farmer-consumer (share giver-share taker) relations which are mediated by digital
platforms. They share different bundles of rights, mainly withdrawal (e.g. milk, cheese, meat) or access rights
(e.g. cow visits, exploring Alpine pastures/farm), while share takers hold all management, exclusion and alienation
rights while also bearing the major risks and obligations within the sharing arrangement. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The ability to obtain accurate estimates of city-wide urban traffic patterns is essential for the
development of effective intelligent transportation systems and the efficient operation of smart
mobility platforms. This paper focuses on the network-wide traffic speed estimation, using trajectory
data generated by a city-wide fleet of ride-sourcing vehicles equipped with GPS-capable
smartphones. A cell-based map-matching technique is proposed to link vehicle trajectories with
road geometries, and to produce network-wide spatio-temporal speed matrices. Data limitations
are addressed using the Schatten p-norm matrix completion algorithm, which can minimize speed
estimation errors even with high rates of data unavailability. A case study using data from
Chengdu, China, demonstrates that the algorithm performs well even in situations involving
continuous data loss over a few hours, and consequently, addresses large-scale network-wide
traffic state estimation problems with missing data, while at the same time outperforming other
data recovery techniques that were used as benchmarks. Our approach can be used to generate
congestion maps that can help monitor and visualize traffic dynamics across the network, and
therefore form the basis for new traffic management, proactive congestion identification, and
congestion mitigation strategies. </td>

Nowadays, transportation data are shared across multiple entities using heterogeneous
mediums, from paper collected data to smartphone. Most of this data are stored in central servers
that are susceptible to hacks. In some cases shady actors who may have access to such sources,
share the mobility data with unwanted third parties. A multi-layered Blockchain framework for
Smart Mobility Data-market (BSMD) is presented for addressing the associated privacy, security,
management, and scalability challenges. Each participant shares their encrypted data to the
blockchain network and can transact information with other participants as long as both parties
agree to the transaction rules issued by the owner of the data. Data ownership, transparency,
auditability and access control are the core principles of the proposed blockchain for smart
mobility data-market. In a case study of real-time mobility data sharing, we demonstrate the
performance of BSMD on a 370 nodes blockchain running on heterogeneous and geographically separated
devices communicating on a physical network. We also demonstrate how BSMD ensures
the cybersecurity and privacy of individual by safeguarding against spoofing and message
interception attacks and providing information access management control. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> No-car zone is becoming a trend in many parts of the world, mainly driven by environmental
motives. Recent data has shown that both vehicle kilometers traveled and car ownership are on
the decline, especially in developed countries. This has been coupled with the rise of new urban
mobility concepts such as smart mobility, car sharing, and green modes. Can we push for these
policies without compromising traffic circulation? The Braess Paradox (BP) suggests that road
closure can, in fact, improve traffic congestion; dubbed as the Braess Paradox Detection Problem
(BPDP). This study aims to leverage the BP to boost the idea of the no-car zone. To this end, we
formulate the BPDP as a bilevel problem and develop a heuristic methodology (a surrogate-based
algorithm) to identify roads for closure in the heart of the cities to be reclaimed for green space,
pedestrian plazas, and so on. Furthermore, our proposed formulation considers travel demand
elasticity resulting from road-closure schemes while solving for the BPDP. We test the methodology
using a real dataset, the road network of Winnipeg. The results indicate strong evidence
and justification supporting the idea of no-car zone even in the heart of highly congested cities. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In this research, we investigate the acceptability of three new and emerging smart mobility
options and quantify the associated willingness-to-pay values in the context of Lisbon
using a comprehensive stated preferences (SP) survey. The smart mobility options include
shared taxi, one-way car rental, and a novel combination of park-and-ride and school bus
facilities. While previous surveys on smart mobility options had investigated limited number
of alternatives in isolation, the SP survey used in this research presents the smart
mobility options alongside the existing options and their traditional variants like congestion
pricing and improved public transport systems. Further, the choice of mode, departure
time and occupancy are investigated in a multidimensional framework. This resulted a
large choice set (with 9 modes, 5 departure times, and 2 occupancy levels leading to 135
alternatives in total) and required a novel survey design.
The main survey administered over the internet and computer aided personal interviews
included 2372 valid SP observations from 1248 respondents. Multi-dimensional mixed
logit models were used to capture the complex correlations introduced due to the nontraditional
survey design. Results indicate a significant preference of one-way car rental
and shared taxi for non-commute trips. For commute trips, improved versions of traditional
public transport modes are favoured over smart mobility options. These findings,
as well as the novel data collection and modelling approach, are expected to provide
important information to transportation planners and policy makers working to implement
smart mobility options in Lisbon as well as in other cities. </td>

mobility trends </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper makes a critical contribution to the discussion about the transition from an automobile
society to a multimodal society in Western transport and mobility research, which is characterised
by a flexible use of different transport options. This discussion is fuelled, in particular,
by the emergence of smart mobility, in which information and communication technologies
(ICTs) – e.g., the smartphone – are used to switch flexibly between new interconnected mobility
services (such as carsharing, ridesharing, bikesharing, bus or train). The starting point for the
scepticism towards this transition is the research on transport poverty, which problematizes
social exclusions from participation in mobility due to the unequal distribution of mode options.
This paper suggests a change of perspective from the real mode choice to potential/optional
mode choice in order to account for this scepticism in the research on multimodal behaviours.
Multioptionality is conceptualised as a necessary precondition for multimodal behaviours to
achieve this change of perspective. Based on this conceptualisation, three theses result from a
quantitative analysis of a data set from an area in the Rhine-Main region in Germany. The theses
challenge the often-postulated potential ubiquity of multimodal behaviours: (i) Transport poverty
– represented by a lack of mode options – inhibits the potential production of multimodal
behaviours, particularly by socially marginalised people (low income, low education, precarious
job situation, etc.). (ii) A multimodal divide describes the reproduction of transport poverty in
the guise of modernisation, as the transport poor – with few mode options – also lack certain ICTs
that provide central access media to smart mobility. (iii) Another (perfidious) form of social
exclusion from participation in smart mobility concerns critical thinkers who avoid installing
mobility applications to protect their privacy. This exclusion occurs because these apps do not
have an alternative as access software to smart mobility. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Highly automated vehicles (HAVs) generate the optimistic prospect of future smart mobility
together with the disruptive influence of traditional policies. Formulating appropriate policies
based on applicable methods are necessary to cope with the potential uncertainties of HAVs. By
reviewing the literature in a structural manner, this paper analyzes the emerging importance and
research frontiers in formulating HAV policies and presents insights gained from three major
methods of dealing with uncertain, dynamic, and evolving transport problems. First, the formulation
of HAV policy is important for at least three reasons: it may accelerate the development
and control of potential uncertainties of HAV, balance technology innovations with traffic security,
and provide a steady and efficient migration from human drivers to automated driving
systems. Second, current research focuses mainly on the role of government, licensing and testing
standards, certification, reliability, policy interventions, public health, legal challenges, and restrictive
or supportive policies. A common research framework and methodology of HAV systems
has not yet been established to deal with the uncertainties of technology security. Finally, three
potential methods of formulating HAV policy are identified herein, namely (1) the backcasting
method, which could determine the future of HAV objectives and pathways; (2) the dynamic
adaptive method, which makes the policy transition to HAV systems more organic and dynamic;
and (3) the policy transfer and migration method, which provides a clear vision of the adaptation
procedure. These methods are used in different circumstances to formulate HAV policies. Each
method has its pros and cons. The present review provides insights into formulating future HAV
policies using these methods. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2020 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In this paper we focus on the development of a new service model for accessing transport, namely
Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and present one of the first critical analyses of the rhetoric surrounding
the concept. One central assumption of one prevalent MaaS conceptualization is that
transport services are bundled into service packages for monthly payment, as in the telecommunication
or media service sectors. Various other forms of MaaS are being developed but all
tend to offer door-to-door multi-modal mobility services, brokered via digital platforms connecting
users and service operators. By drawing on literature concerned with socio-technical
transitions, we address two multi-layered questions. First, to what extent can the MaaS promises
(to citizens and cities) be delivered, and what are the unanticipated societal implications that
could arise from a wholesale adoption of MaaS in relation to key issues such as wellbeing,
emissions and social inclusion? Second, what are de facto challenges for urban governance if the
packaged services model of MaaS is widely adopted, and what are the recommended responses?
To address these questions, we begin by considering the evolution of intelligent transport systems
that underpin the current vision of MaaS and highlight how the new business model could
provide a mechanism to make MaaS truly disruptive. We then identify a set of plausible unanticipated
societal effects that have implications for urban planning and transport governance.
This is followed by a critical assessment of the persuasive rhetoric around MaaS that makes grand
promises about efficiency, choice and freedom. Our conclusion is that the range of possible
unanticipated consequences carries risks that require public intervention (i.e. steering) for reasons
of both efficiency and equity. </td>

start-ups, incumbent industries, policy actors and consultants proposing to harness the power of digital techniques
to improve and transform cycling experiences, infrastructures, and gadgets. This ‘smartification of cycling’
is a phenomenon that is increasingly attracting attention and a variety of interests, fuelled both by the
processes of transitioning to smart mobility and a boom of attention to cycling in cities worldwide. However,
proposed cycling futures, both implicit and explicit, receive little critical scrutiny. Here, we fill this gap by
mapping smart cycling innovations and their key features. We examine how innovations are believed to change
the way cycling is practiced, made sense of and governed. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we
analyse 86 website texts of smart cycling innovations and systematically outline changes envisioned by innovators.
Having identified tensions between and within a range of promised futures, we conclude that smart
cycling futures are multiple and contested, just as cycling presents are. Therefore, we propose a number of
questions for further research to advance a more nuanced understanding of the range of futures of smart cycling
in academic thinking and potentially to support decision-making at different levels of governance.
Understanding diverse, contested, embodied and embedded cycling presents is part and parcel of imagining and
co-creating (smart) cycling futures. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper presents a systematic way of understanding and modeling traveler behavior in
response to on-demand mobility services. We explicitly consider the sequential and yet
inter-connected decision-making stages specific to on-demand service usage. The framework
includes a hybrid choice model for service subscription, and three logit mixture models
with inter-consumer heterogeneity for the service access, menu product choice and optout
choice. Different models are connected by feeding logsums. The proposed modeling
framework is essential for accounting the impacts of real-time on-demand system’s dynamics
on traveler behaviors and capturing consumer heterogeneity, thus being greatly relevant
for integrations in multi-modal dynamic simulators. The methodology is applied to a
case study of an innovative personalized on-demand real-time system which incentivizes
travelers to select more sustainable travel options. The data for model estimation is collected
through a smartphone-based context-aware stated preference survey. Through model
estimation, lower values of time are observed when the respondents opt to use the reward
system. The perception of incentives and schedule delay by different population segments
are quantified. These results are fundamental in setting the ground for different behavioral
scenarios of such a new on-demand system. The proposed methodology is flexible to be
applied to model other on-demand mobility services such as ride-hailing services and the
emerging mobility as a service. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2020 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Given the innovative nature of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), various uncertainties are surrounding the possibilities
for implementing MaaS. This includes uncertainties about alternative MaaS-system functionalities, about
how the implementation of alternative MaaS systems might affect the overall transport system performance and
about the preferences of stakeholders regarding alternative MaaS system implementation strategies. This paper
contributes to this niche by collecting expert opinions about these uncertainties, using the Delphi method.
The expert panel expected a fully-integrated MaaS to start operating in urban areas before 2020 and to
expand to rural areas and nationally within the period of 2020–2030. In contrast to the common expectation that
MaaS will attract regular car driver from their vehicles, our panel expected youth, current public transport users,
and flexible travellers to be early adopters of MaaS. Transport operators are seen as the most important actors
and the most preferred MaaS service integrator. Local authorities are expected to have an important role in
enabling MaaS. The main objectives for implementing MaaS are to reduce car dependency and to provide a
flexible and more customised transport system accessibility to the general public. The implementation of MaaS
as a pilot project is considered the most preferred policy in the next phase. These findings largely support earlier
reported findings on MaaS implementation.
This study report new findings regarding the levels of consensus and how the experts changed their individual
opinions in light of the group results on the studied topics. Regarding certain topics, such as the early market,
there are higher levels of agreements among the panel with lower proportions of them changing their selections
in light of the group results. Whereas in other topics, such as planning for future implementation, the level of
agreement are lower with higher proportions of experts changing their selections. These two attributes can be
combined to infer how certain the panel is on the topics studied. The study also provides new insights into the
possible vulnerabilities and opportunities that can arise in relation to MaaS implementation, the associated levels
of importance and uncertainty, and the possible responding actions. The experts also identified potential social
issues and challenges in scaling-up the pilot. The findings of this study are of interest to practitioners and
researchers in the field of MaaS planning and can be used to initiate a discussion among actors and stakeholders
to formulate implementation plans for different MaaS concepts. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Smart mobility services, such as carsharing or ridesharing, are often promoted by their providers as the key to a
sustainable transport future. However, they are also associated with risks such as increased congestion and
inequality. This paper argues that state intervention is essential in order to mitigate such risks, and steer smart
mobility in a way that contributes to the delivery of sustainable transport. We use London and Seattle as case
studies to explore whether the regulation they have introduced can hold smart mobility providers accountable
for their impacts on the urban environment, and if the accountability arrangements that are in place in each city
can help local governments achieve their strategic goals for smart mobility. Our original finding is that there are
three key features of regulations that are essential for shaping and steering smart mobility: regulations should be
directed to specific types of smart mobility; should clearly set out providers’ responsibilities and what happens if
they fail to fulfill them; and should seek to clearly align the smart mobility offer with the cities’ long-term
strategies. We conclude that Seattle’s regulatory approach is more likely to help the city achieve its ambitions
for smart mobility, but we also highlight that regulation is only one element of smart mobility governance and
careful consideration needs to be given to the role, if any, smart mobility will play in delivering a sustainable
transport future. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The collection of big data, as an alternative to traditional resource intensive
manual data collection approaches, has become
significantly more feasible over the past decade. The availability of
such data, coupled with more sophisticated predictive statistical
techniques, has contributed to an increase in attention towards
the application of these data, particularly for transportation
analysis. Within the transportation literature, there is a growing
emphasis on developing sources of commonly collected public
transportation data into more powerful analytical tools. A
commonly held belief is that application of big data to
transportation problems will yield new insights previously
unattainable through traditional transportation data sets. However,
there exist many ambiguities related to what constitutes big data,
the ethical implications of big data collection and application, and
how to best utilize the emerging data sets. The existing literature
exploring big data provides no clear and consistent definition.
While the collection of big data has grown and its application in
both research and practice continues to expand, there is a
significant disparity between methods of analysis applied to such
data. This paper summarizes the recent literature on sources of big
data and commonly applied methods used in its application to
public transportation problems. We assess predominant big data
sources, most frequently studied topics, and methodologies
employed. The literature suggests smart card and automated data
are the two big data sources most frequently used by researchers
to conduct public transit analyses. The studies reviewed indicate
that big data has largely been used to understand transit users’
travel behavior and to assess public transit service quality. The
techniques reported in the literature largely mirror those used with
smaller data sets. The application of more advanced statistical
methods, commonly associated with big data, has been limited to
a small number of studies. In order to fully capture the value of
big data, new approaches to analysis will be necessary. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The information-rich vessel movement data provided by the
Automatic Identification System (AIS) has gained much popularity
over the past decade, during which the employment of satellite based
receivers has enabled wide coverage and improved data
quality. The application of AIS data has developed from simply
navigation-oriented research to now include trade flow
estimation, emission accounting, and vessel performance
monitoring. The AIS now provides high frequency, real-time
positioning and sailing patterns for almost the whole world’s
commercial fleet, and therefore, in combination with
supplementary databases and analyses, AIS data has arguably
kickstarted the era of digitisation in the shipping industry. In this
study, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature
regarding AIS applications by dividing it into three development
stages, namely, basic application, extended application, and
advanced application. Each stage contains two to three
application fields, and in total we identified seven application
fields, including (1) AIS data mining, (2) navigation safety, (3) ship
behaviour analysis, (4) environmental evaluation, (5) trade analysis,
(6) ship and port performance, and (7) Arctic shipping. We found
that the original application of AIS data to navigation safety has,
with the improvement of data accessibility, evolved into diverse
applications in various directions. Moreover, we summarised the
major methodologies in the literature into four categories, these
being (1) data processing and mining, (2) index measurement, (3)
causality analysis, and (4) operational research. Undoubtedly, the
applications of AIS data will be further expanded in the
foreseeable future. This will not only provide a more
comprehensive understanding of voyage performance and allow
researchers to examine shipping market dynamics from the micro
level, but also the abundance of AIS data may also open up the
rather opaque aspect of how shipping companies release
information to external authorities, including the International
Maritime Organization, port states, scientists and researchers. It is
expected that more multi-disciplinary AIS studies will emerge in
the coming years. We believe that this study will shed further
light on the future development of AIS studies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper reviews the activity-travel behaviour literature that
employs Machine Learning (ML) techniques for empirical analysis
and modelling. Machine Learning algorithms, which attempt to
build intelligence utilizing the availability of large amounts of
data, have emerged as powerful tools in the fields of pattern
recognition and big data analysis. These techniques have been
applied in activity-travel behaviour studies since the early ’90s
when Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were employed to model
mode choice decisions. AMOS, an activity-based modelling
system developed in the mid-’90s, has ANN at its core to model
and predict individual responses to travel demand management
measures. In the dawn of 2000, ALBATROSS, a comprehensive
activity-based travel demand modelling system, was proposed by
Arentze and Timmermans using Decision Trees. Since then
researchers have been exploring ML techniques like Support
Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Neural Networks
(NN), Bayes Classifiers, and more recently, Ensemble Learners to
model and predict activity-travel behaviour. A large number of
publications over the years and an upward trend in the number
of published articles over time indicate that Machine Learning is
a promising tool for activity-travel behaviour analysis and
prediction. This article, first of its kind in the literature, reviews
these studies and explores the trends in activity-travel behaviour
research that apply ML techniques. The review finds that mode
choice decisions have received wide attention in the literature on
ML applications. It was observed that most of the studies identify
the lack of interpretability as a serious shortcoming in ML
techniques. However, very few studies have attempted to
improve the interpretability of the models. Further, some studies
report the importance of feature engineering in ML-based
studies, but very few studies adopt feature engineering before
model development. Spatiotemporal transferability of models is
another issue that has received minimal attention in the
literature. In the end, the paper discusses possible directions for
future research in the area of activity-travel behaviour modelling
using ML techniques. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Existing methods for calibrating link fundamental diagrams (FDs) often focus on a limited
number of links and use grouping strategies that are largely dependent on roadway physical
attributes alone. In this study, we propose a big data-driven two-stage clustering
framework to calibrate link FDs for freeway networks. The first stage captures, under normal
traffic state, the variations of link FDs over multiple days based on which links are clustered
in the second stage. Two methods, i.e. the standard k-means algorithm combined
with hierarchical clustering and a modified hierarchical clustering based on the Fréchet
distance, are applied in the first stage to obtain the FD parameter matrix for each link.
The calibrated matrices are input into the second stage where the modified hierarchical
clustering is re-employed as a static approach resulting in multiple clusters of links. To further
consider the variations of link FDs, the static approach is extended by modifying the
similarity measure through the principle component analysis (PCA). The resulting multivariate
time-series clustering models the distributions of the FD parameters as a dynamic
approach. The proposed framework is applied on the Melbourne freeway network using
one-year worth of loop detector data. Results have shown that (a) similar roadway physical
attributes do not necessarily result in similar link FDs, (b) the connectivity-based approach
performs better in clustering link FDs as compared with the centroid-based approach, and
(c) the proposed framework helps achieving a better understanding of the spatial distribution
of links with similar FDs and the associated variations and distributions of the FD
parameters. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In this paper, a decision support approach is proposed for condition-based maintenance of rails
relying on expert-based systems. The methodology takes into account both the actual conditions
of the rails (using axle box acceleration measurements and rail video images) and the prior
knowledge of the railway track. The approach provides an integrated estimation of the rail health
conditions to support the maintenance decisions for a given time period. An expert-based system
is defined to analyse interdependency between the prior knowledge of the track (defined by
influential factors) and the surface defect measurements over the rail. When the rail health
conditions is computed, the different track segments are prioritized, in order to facilitate grinding
planning of those segments of rail that are prone to critical conditions. In this paper, real-life rail
conditions measurements from the track Amersfoort-Weert in the Dutch railway network are
used to show the benefits of the proposed methodology. The results support infrastructure
managers to analyse the problems in their rail infrastructure and to efficiently perform a condition-
based maintenance decision making. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently demonstrated the capability to predict traffic flow
with big data. While existing DNN models can provide better performance than shallow models,
it is still an open issue of making full use of spatial-temporal characteristics of the traffic flow to
improve their performance. In addition, our understanding of them on traffic data remains
limited. This paper proposes a DNN based traffic flow prediction model (DNN-BTF) to improve
the prediction accuracy. The DNN-BTF model makes full use of weekly/daily periodicity and
spatial-temporal characteristics of traffic flow. Inspired by recent work in machine learning, an
attention based model was introduced that automatically learns to determine the importance of
past traffic flow. The convolutional neural network was also used to mine the spatial features and
the recurrent neural network to mine the temporal features of traffic flow. We also showed
through visualization how DNN-BTF model understands traffic flow data and presents a challenge
to conventional thinking about neural networks in the transportation field that neural
networks is purely a “black-box” model. Data from open-access database PeMS was used to validate
the proposed DNN-BTF model on a long-term horizon prediction task. Experimental results
demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. </td>

Nowadays, transportation data are shared across multiple entities using heterogeneous
mediums, from paper collected data to smartphone. Most of this data are stored in central servers
that are susceptible to hacks. In some cases shady actors who may have access to such sources,
share the mobility data with unwanted third parties. A multi-layered Blockchain framework for
Smart Mobility Data-market (BSMD) is presented for addressing the associated privacy, security,
management, and scalability challenges. Each participant shares their encrypted data to the
blockchain network and can transact information with other participants as long as both parties
agree to the transaction rules issued by the owner of the data. Data ownership, transparency,
auditability and access control are the core principles of the proposed blockchain for smart
mobility data-market. In a case study of real-time mobility data sharing, we demonstrate the
performance of BSMD on a 370 nodes blockchain running on heterogeneous and geographically separated
devices communicating on a physical network. We also demonstrate how BSMD ensures
the cybersecurity and privacy of individual by safeguarding against spoofing and message

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The rapid growth of internet based ride-sharing brings great changes to residents' travel and city
traffic. However, few studies had employed empirical data to examine the unique travel patterns
of internet based ride-sharing trips. In this paper, we compare taxi trip records and internet based
ride-sharing trip records provided by DiDi company. Results reveal many interesting findings that
had never been reported before. From the viewpoint of service patterns, ride-sharing mainly
increases supplies in hot areas and peak hours. By applying a non-negative matrix factorization
method, we find that ride-sharing principally serves as an approach for commuting. So, as an
effective supplement to traditional taxi service, it regulates spatial and temporal supply-demand
imbalance, especially during morning and evening rush periods. From the viewpoint of individual
behavior patterns, we use a clustering method to identify two kinds of internet based
ride-sharing drivers. The first kind of drivers usually provides ride-sharing along daily homework
commuting. Trips served by these drivers have relatively constant origin-designation (OD)
pairs. The second kind of drivers does not serve regularly and roams around the city even in
working hours. Therefore, there are no constant OD pairs in their ride-sharing trips.
Counterintuitively, we find that home-work commuting drivers account for only a small part of
total drivers and they only serve a small number of commuting trips. In addition, internet based
ride-sharing is not just traditional hitchhiking worked through mobile internet. We find that
internet based ride-sharing drivers intend to make long distance trips, and they intend to detour
further to pick up or drop off passengers than traditional hitchhike drivers since they are paid. All
these findings are helpful for policy makers at all levels to make informed decisions about deployment
of internet based ride-sharing service. This paper also verifies that big data analytics is
particularly useful and powerful in the analysis of ride-sharing and taxi service patterns. </td>

event, and work zone information. The second model is a kernel regression that captures trainspecific
dynamics. A mesoscopic simulation model that accounts for travel and dwell time variations
as well as inferred track occupation conflicts, train connections and rolling stock rotations,
is additionally considered. The models have been used in a proof of concept to forecast
delays for nationwide passenger services network of Deutsche Bahn, which operates roughly

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Knowledge of trip travel times serves an important role in transportation management and control.
Existing travel time estimation approaches generally cover empirical ones, statistical ones and
hybrid ones. Despite strong tractability, the empirical approaches cannot sufficiently capture diverse
travel time distributions (TTDs) and often encounter some issues (e.g., assumption of a
predefined distribution, failure of significance tests). Statistical and hybrid methods possess better
generalization in estimating heterogeneous TTDs, but fail to model the network-wide spatiotemporal
correlations, which have been found useful in the TTD estimation. To address these
drawbacks, this paper proposes a deep learning based Trip Information Maximizing Generative
Adversarial Network (T-InfoGAN). In this method, the trip TTD is estimated by modeling the joint
distribution of travel times of two successive links with the consideration of network-wide spatiotemporal
correlations. Meanwhile, a dynamic clustering with Wasserstein distance (DCWD) algorithm
is used to explore the traffic state transitions for link pairs and cluster the link pairs with
similar TTDs into one group, which benefits the training and estimation processes of T-InfoGAN.
Then, based on GPS trajectory data from Didi Chuxing in Chengdu city, China, numerical results
show that the T-InfoGAN with DCWD can well estimate three mini trip TTDs with various features,
and performs better than three other counterparts (i.e., Convolution method, MC-Grid method, and
MC-GMMS method) in estimating the TTDs of two longer trips. In summary, this study is the first
successful try to estimate trip TTDs within the framework of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs), and the deep learning based T-InfoGAN is a promising approach to estimate heterogeneous
trip TTDs with the better generalization and flexibility in the big data era. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Currently, deep learning has been successfully applied in many fields and achieved amazing
results. Meanwhile, big data has revolutionized the transportation industry over the
past several years. These two hot topics have inspired us to reconsider the traditional issue
of passenger flow prediction. As a special structure of deep neural network (DNN), an
autoencoder can deeply and abstractly extract the nonlinear features embedded in the
input without any labels. By exploiting its remarkable capabilities, a novel hourly passenger
flow prediction model using deep learning methods is proposed in this paper. Temporal
features including the day of a week, the hour of a day, and holidays, the scenario features
including inbound and outbound, and tickets and cards, and the passenger flow features
including the previous average passenger flow and real-time passenger flow, are defined
as the input features. These features are combined and trained as different stacked autoencoders
(SAE) in the first stage. Then, the pre-trained SAE are further used to initialize the
supervised DNN with the real-time passenger flow as the label data in the second stage.
The hybrid model (SAE-DNN) is applied and evaluated with a case study of passenger flow
prediction for four bus rapid transit (BRT) stations of Xiamen in the third stage. The experimental
results show that the proposed method has the capability to provide a more accurate
and universal passenger flow prediction model for different BRT stations with different
passenger flow profiles. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Dense cities with complex transport infrastructure and numerous Places of Interest (POIs)
pose challenges to interpersonal interactions since the location and the time of conducting
a joint activity are rarely agreed unanimously from all agents, mainly due to lack of information
of each agent’s schedule and activity preferences.
In this paper, a utility maximization model for capturing automatically users’ willingness
to travel a certain distance for participating in different activity types based on user-generated
data is introduced. The model is based on Big-Data analytics on user-generated data
from Social Media that can offer valuable insights into users’ preferences and improve our
understanding on their decision-making mechanisms for selecting joint activities. Unlike
static approaches, the utility model of each agent is developed to incorporate continuously
updated data feeds regarding agents’ activities (i.e., timing of visiting a POI, type of POI).
The agent-utility model is implemented and tested via utilizing geo-tagged, social media
data from 65 individuals from the dense city of London (crawling campaign from November
2012–January 2014). After implementing the utility-maximization model, all users are
clustered based on their willingness to travel similar distances to participate in certain
types of activities, facilitating the development of applications for suggesting joint

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The advent of Big Data era has transformed the outlook of numerous fields in science and
engineering. The transportation arena also has great expectations of taking the advantage
of Big Data enabled by the popularization of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In
this study, the viability of a proactive real-time traffic monitoring strategy evaluating
operation and safety simultaneously was explored. The objective is to improve the system
performance of urban expressways by reducing congestion and crash risk. In particular,
Microwave Vehicle Detection System (MVDS) deployed on an expressway network in
Orlando was utilized to achieve the objectives. The system consisting of 275 detectors
covers 75 miles of the expressway network, with average spacing less than 1 mile.
Comprehensive traffic flow parameters per lane are continuously archived on one-minute
interval basis. The scale of the network, dense deployment of detection system, richness of
information and continuous collection turn MVDS as the ideal source of Big Data. It was
found that congestion on urban expressways was highly localized and time-specific. As
expected, the morning and evening peak hours were the most congested time periods.
The results of congestion evaluation encouraged real-time safety analysis to unveil the
effects of traffic dynamics on crash occurrence. Data mining (random forest) and
Bayesian inference techniques were implemented in real-time crash prediction models.
The identified effects, both indirect (peak hour, higher volume and lower speed upstream
of crash locations) and direct (higher congestion index downstream to crash locations)
congestion indicators confirmed the significant impact of congestion on rear-end crash
likelihood. As a response, reliability analysis was introduced to determine the appropriate
time to trigger safety warnings according to the congestion intensity. Findings of this paper
demonstrate the importance to jointly monitor and improve traffic operation and safety.
The Big Data generated by the ITS systems is worth further exploration to bring all their
full potential for more proactive traffic management </td>

policy for the inspection and maintenance of track geometry. Both preventive maintenance
and spot corrective maintenance are taken into account in the investigation of a 33-month inspection
dataset that contains a variety of geometry measurements for every foot of track. First,
this study separates the data based on the time interval of the inspection run, calculates the
aggregate track quality index (TQI) for each track section, and predicts the track spot geo-defect
occurrence probability using random forests. Then, a Markov chain is built to model aggregated
track deterioration, and the spot geo-defects are modeled by a Bernoulli process. Finally, a
Markov decision process (MDP) is developed for track maintenance decision making, and it is
optimized by using a value iteration algorithm. Compared with the existing maintenance policy
using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, the maintenance policy developed in this
paper results in an approximately 10% savings in the total maintenance costs for every 1 mile of

   <td style="text-align:left;"> With the help of automated fare collection systems in the metro network, more and more smart
card (SC) data has been widely accumulated, which includes abundant information (i.e., Big
Data). However, its inability to record passengers’ transfer information and factors affecting
passengers’ travel behaviors (e.g., socio-demographics) limits further potential applications. In
contrast, self-reported Revealed Preference (RP) data can be collected via questionnaire surveys
to include those factors; however, its sample size is usually very small in comparison to SC data.
The purpose of this study is to propose a new set of approaches of estimating metro passengers’
path choices by combining self-reported RP and SC data. These approaches have the following
attractive features. The most important feature is to jointly estimate these two data sets based on
a nested model structure with a balance parameter by accommodating different scales of the two
data sets. The second feature is that a path choice model is built to incorporate stochastic travel
time budget and latent individual risk-averse attitude toward travel time variations, where the
former is derived from the latter and the latter is further represented based on a latent variable
model with observed individual socio-demographics. The third feature is that an algorithm of
combining the two types of data is developed by integrating an Expectation-Maximization algorithm
and a nested logit model estimation method. The above-proposed approaches are examined
based on data from Guangzhou Metro, China. The results show the superiority of combined
data over single data source in terms of both estimation and forecasting performance. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> As a pinnacle of green transportation with transit attributes, bikesharing has become particularly
popular since the mid-2000s. Taking the opportunity of accessing to a large-scale
and smart-card-based dataset from Nanjing, China, this paper explores bikesharing travel
time and trip chain patterns by gender and day of the week. Bikesharing trip chain is
defined and classified into four types according to the complexity of chain. Z-score analysis
and visual analytic techniques, as well as chi-statistic, are adopted to explore the variation
of bikesharing travel time and trip chain. The results suggest that the residential areas are
the primary fountainhead where bikesharing demands generate, whilst the rail stations are
the most attractive hubs that the bikesharing trips terminate at. The travel time between
the same bikesharing station can be two times longer than it is from one station to another.
Bikesharing travel time also differs significantly in terms of gender and day of the week.
With respect to bikesharing trip chain patterns, significant variation is observed between
men and women, as well as between weekdays and weekends. Findings indicate that women
are more likely to make multiple-circle bikesharing trip chains than men, especially on
weekdays. Moreover, the visual analytic gives bikesharing operators direct sense of the
variation of bikesharing trip chain patterns with respect to gender and day of the week.
Last but not least, this paper finds that there is big gap between bikesharing demand
and supply in the adjacent area of rail stations in Nanjing, in particular, during afternoon
peak hours. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Lane-based road information plays a critical role in transportation systems, a lane-based intersection
map is the most important component in a detailed road map of the transportation infrastructure.
Researchers have developed various algorithms to detect the spatial layout of intersections
based on sensor data such as high-definition images/videos, laser point cloud data,
and GPS traces, which can recognize intersections and road segments; however, most approaches
do not automatically generate Lane-based Intersection Maps (LIMs). The objective of our study is
to generate LIMs automatically from crowdsourced big trace data using a multi-hierarchy feature
extraction strategy. The LIM automatic generation method proposed in this paper consists of the
initial recognition of road intersections, intersection layout detection, and lane-based intersection
map-generation. The initial recognition process identifies intersection and non-intersection areas
using spatial clustering algorithms based on the similarity of angle and distance. The intersection
layout is composed of exit and entry points, obtained by combining trajectory integration algorithms
and turn rules at road intersections. The LIM generation step is finally derived from the
intersection layout detection results and lane-based road information, based on geometric
matching algorithms. The effectiveness of our proposed LIM generation method is demonstrated
using crowdsourced vehicle traces. Additional comparisons and analysis are also conducted to
confirm recognition results. Experiments show that the proposed method saves time and facilitates
LIM refinement from crowdsourced traces more efficiently than methods based on other
types of sensor data. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Aiming to develop a theoretically consistent framework to estimate travel demand using multiple
data sources, this paper first proposes a multi-layered Hierarchical Flow Network (HFN) representation
to structurally model different levels of travel demand variables including trip
generation, origin/destination matrices, path/link flows, and individual behavior parameters.
Different data channels from household travel surveys, smartphone type devices, global position
systems, and sensors can be mapped to different layers of the proposed network structure. We
introduce Big data-driven Transportation Computational Graph (BTCG), alternatively Beijing
Transportation Computational Graph, as the underlying mathematical modeling tool to perform
automatic differentiation on layers of composition functions. A feedforward passing on the HFN
sequentially implements 3 steps of the traditional 4-step process: trip generation, spatial distribution
estimation, and path flow-based traffic assignment, respectively. BTCG can aggregate
different layers of partial first-order gradients and use the back-propagation of “loss errors” to
update estimated demand variables. A comparative analysis indicates that the proposed methods
can effectively integrate different data sources and offer a consistent representation of demand.
The proposed methodology is also evaluated under a demonstration network in a Beijing subnetwork. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Rail network velocity is defined as system-wide average speed of line-haul movement
between terminals. To accommodate increased service demand and load on rail networks,
increase in network velocity, without compromising safety, is required. Among many
determinants of overall network velocity, a key driver is service interruption, including
lowered operating speed due to track/train condition and delays caused by derailments.
Railroads have put significant infrastructure and inspection programs in place to avoid service
interruptions. One of the key measures is an extensive network of wayside mechanical
condition detectors (temperature, strain, vision, infrared, weight, impact, etc.) that monitor
the rolling-stock as it passes by. The detectors are designed to alert for conditions that
either violate regulations set by governmental rail safety agencies or deteriorating rolling-
stock conditions as determined by the railroad.
Using huge volumes of historical detector data, in combination with failure data, maintenance
action data, inspection schedule data, train type data and weather data, we are
exploring several analytical approaches including, correlation analysis, causal analysis,
time series analysis and machine learning techniques to automatically learn rules and
build failure prediction models. These models will be applied against both historical and
real-time data to predict conditions leading to failure in the future, thus avoiding service
interruptions and increasing network velocity. Additionally, the analytics and models
can also be used for detecting root cause of several failure modes and wear rate of components,
which, while do not directly address network velocity, can be proactively used by
maintenance organizations to optimize trade-offs related to maintenance schedule, costs
and shop capacity. As part of our effort, we explore several avenues to machine learning
techniques including distributed learning and hierarchical analytical approaches. </td>

of our transportation needs and environment. For this purpose, ITS systems are
steadily being rolled out, providing a wealth of information, and transitionary technologies,
such as computer vision applied to low-cost surveillance or consumer cameras, are already

This paper presents, in detail, a practical framework for implementation of an automated,
high-resolution, video-based traffic-analysis system, particularly geared towards
researchers for behavioural studies and road safety analysis, or practitioners for traffic flow
model validation. This system collects large amounts of microscopic traffic flow data from
ordinary traffic using CCTV and consumer-grade video cameras and provides the tools for
conducting basic traffic flow analyses as well as more advanced, pro-active safety and
behaviour studies. This paper demonstrates the process step-by-step, illustrated with
examples, and applies the methodology to a case study of a large and detailed study of
roundabouts (nearly 80,000 motor vehicles tracked up to 30 times per second driving
through a roundabout).
In addition to providing a rich set of behavioural data about Time-to-Collision and gap
times at nearly 40 roundabout weaving zones, some data validation is performed using
the standard Measure of Tracking Accuracy with results in the 85–95% range. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In batch map matching the objective is to derive from a time series of position data the sequence
of road segments visited by the traveler for posterior analysis. Taking into account the limited
accuracy of both the map and the measurement devices several different movements over network
links may have generated the observed measurements. The set of candidate solutions can be
reduced by adding assumptions about the traveller’s behavior (e.g. respecting speed limits, using
shortest paths, etc.). The set of feasible assumptions however, is constrained by the intended
posterior analysis of the link sequences produced by map matching. This paper proposes a
method that only uses the spatio-temporal information contained in the input data (GPS recordings)
not reduced by any additional assumption.
The method partitions the trace of GPS recordings so that all recordings in a part are
chronologically consecutive and match the same set of road segments. Each such trace part leads
to a collection of partial routes that can be qualified by their likelihood to have generated the
trace part. Since the trace parts are chronologically ordered, an acyclic directed graph can be
used to find the best chain of partial routes. It is used to enumerate candidate solutions to the
map matching problem.
Qualification based on behavioral assumptions is added in a separate later stage. Separating
the stages helps to make the underlying assumptions explicit and adaptable to the purpose of the
map matched results. The proposed technique is a multi-hypothesis technique (MHT) that does
not discard any hypothesized path until the second stage.
A road network extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM) is used. In order to validate the method,
synthetic realistic GPS traces were generated from randomly generated routes for different combinations
of device accuracy and recording period. Comparing the base truth to the map matched link
sequences shows that the proposed technique achieves a state of the art accuracy level. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Locating the bottlenecks in cities where traffic congestion usually occurs is essential prior to
solving congestion problems. Therefore, this paper proposes a low-frequency probe vehicle data
(PVD)-based method to identify turn-level intersection traffic congestion in an urban road network.
This method initially divides an urban area into meter-scale square cells and maps PVD
into those cells and then identifies the cells that correspond to road intersections by taking advantage
of the fixed-location stop-and-go characteristics of traffic passing through intersections.
With those rasterized road intersections, the proposed method recognizes probe vehicles’ turning
directions and provides preliminary analysis of traffic conditions at all turning directions. The
proposed method is map-independent (i.e., no digital map is needed) and computationally efficient
and is able to rapidly screen most of the intersections for turn-level congestion in a road
network. Thereby, this method is expected to greatly decrease traffic engineers’ workloads by
providing information regarding where and when to investigate and solve traffic congestion
problems. </td>

more predictable and controllable through a better utilization of data and existing resources. The
realization of these opportunities requires going beyond the existing traditional ways of collecting
traffic data that are based either on fixed-location sensors or GPS devices with low spatial
coverage or penetration rates and significant measurement errors, especially in congested urban
areas. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) or simply “drones” have been proposed as a pioneering
tool of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) infrastructure due to their unique characteristics,
but various challenges have kept these efforts only at a small size. This paper describes
the system architecture and preliminary results of a first-of-its-kind experiment, nicknamed
pNEUMA, to create the most complete urban dataset to study congestion. A swarm of 10 drones
hovering over the central business district of Athens over multiple days to record traffic streams
in a congested area of a 1.3 km2 area with more than 100 km-lanes of road network, around 100
busy intersections (signalized or not), many bus stops and close to half a million trajectories. The
aim of the experiment is to record traffic streams in a multi-modal congested environment over
an urban setting using UAS that can allow the deep investigation of critical traffic phenomena.
The pNEUMA experiment develops a prototype system that offers immense opportunities for
researchers many of which are beyond the interests and expertise of the authors. This open
science initiative creates a unique observatory of traffic congestion, a scale an-order-of-magnitude
higher than what was available till now, that researchers from different disciplines around
the globe can use to develop and test their own models. </td>

However, the absence of charging stations limits the penetration of electric vehicles.
Current approaches for optimizing the locations of charging stations suffer from challenges
associated with spatial–temporal dynamic travel demands and the lengthy period required
for the charging process. The present article uses the electric taxi (ET) as an example to
develop a spatial–temporal demand coverage approach for optimizing the placement of
ET charging stations in the space–time context. To this end, public taxi demands with spatial
and temporal attributes are extracted from massive taxi GPS data. The cyclical interactions
between taxi demands, ETs, and charging stations are modeled with a spatial–
temporal path tool. A location model is developed to maximize the level of ET service on
the road network and the level of charging service at the stations under spatial and temporal
constraints such as the ET range, the charging time, and the capacity of charging stations.
The reduced carbon emission generated by used ETs with located charging stations is
also evaluated. An experiment conducted in Shenzhen, China demonstrates that the proposed
approach not only exhibits good performance in determining ET charging station
locations by considering temporal attributes, but also achieves a high quality trade-off
between the levels of ET service and charging service. The proposed approach and obtained
results help the decision-making of urban ET charging station siting. </td>

Therefore, the ability to obtain valuable sets of data has become one of the key challenges for
researchers. Traditional mobility surveys have many important limitations. In this situation, the
potential of the use of smartphones and dedicated applications in the identification of individual
travel behaviour seem very promising. We set ourselves a goal to indicate strengths and weaknesses
of data obtained with this method and assess the perspectives of its use for the needs of
public policies. For these purposes we prepared a low-cost mobile application and conducted a
pilot study among students in Poznań (Poland). In effect, trajectories of more than 100 people
with almost 3 billion of location data were collected. Based on a literature review and our results
we discuss the main problems, limitations and challenges of the broader use of the data obtained
with smartphones. In the conclusion, we argue that there is a huge and increasing potential
connected with mobile phones, but still some important barriers exist including sampling problems,
limitations in big data analyses and technological issues. Therefore, a broader use of
smartphones in travel behaviour surveys seems to be rather a distant perspective. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Track geometry inspection data is important for managing railway infrastructure integrity and
operational safety. In order to use track geometry inspection data, having accurate and reliable
position information is a prerequisite. Due to various issues identified in this research, the positions
of different track geometry inspections need to be aligned and synchronized to the same
location before being used for track degradation modeling and maintenance planning. This is
referred to as “position synchronization”, a long-standing important research problem in the area
of track data analytics. With the aim of advancing the state of the art in research on this subject,
we propose a novel approach to more accurately and expediently synchronize track geometry
inspection positions via big-data fusion and incremental learning algorithms. Distinguishing it
from other relevant studies in the literature, our proposed approach can simultaneously address
data exceptions, channel offsets and local position offsets between any two inspections. To solve
the Position Synchronization Model (PS-Model), an Incremental Learning Algorithm (ILAlgorithm)
is developed to handle the “lack of memory” challenge for the fast computation of
massive data. A case study is developed based on a dataset with data size of 18 GB, including 58
inspections between February 2014 and July 2016 over 323 km (200 miles) of tracks belonging
to China High Speed Railways. The results show that our proposed model performs robustly
against data exceptions via the use of multi-channel information fusion. Also, the position synchronization
error using our proposed approach is within 0.15 meters (0.5 feet). Our proposed
data-driven, incremental learning algorithm can quickly solve the complex, data-extensive, position
synchronization problem, using an average of 0.1 s for processing one additional kilometer
of track. In general, the data analysis methodology and algorithm presented in this paper are also
suitable to address other relevant position synchronization problems in transportation engineering,
especially when the dataset contains multiple channels of sensors and abnormal data
outliers. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Track geometry data exhibits classical big data attributes: value, volume, velocity, veracity and
variety. Track Quality Indices-TQI are used to obtain average-based assessment of track segments
and schedule track maintenance. TQI is expressed in terms of track parameters like gage, crosslevel,
etc. Though each of these parameters is objectively important but understanding what they
collectively convey for a given track segment often becomes challenging. Several railways including
passenger and freight have developed single indices that combines different track
parameters to assess overall track quality. Some of these railways have selected certain parameters
whilst dropping others. Using track geometry data from a sample mile track, we demonstrate
how to combine track geometry parameters into a low dimensional form (TQI) that
simplifies the track properties without losing much variability in the data. This led us to principal
components. To validate the use of principal components as TQI, we employed a two-phase
approach. First phase was to identify a classic machine learning technique that works well with
track geometry data. The second step was to train the identified machine learning technique on
the sample mile-track data using combined TQIs and principal components as defect predictors.
The performance of the predictors were compared using true and false positive rates. The results
show that three principal components were better at predicting defects and revealing salient
characteristics in track geometry data than combined TQIs even though there were some correlations
that are potentially useful for track maintenance. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Disparities in traffic safety among different regions and driver populations have been investigated
in previous studies. These studies found significant differences in crashes between
population groups and geographical locations with various socio-economic characteristics.
However, driver-behavioral factors, specifically speeding behavior, which is a critical aspect of
traffic safety, have received less attention in case of analyzing the impact of local characteristics
on driver-behavioral choices that might increase the risk of crashes. The impact of local characteristics
on various driver behaviors is getting even more important as the data from the
connected and automated vehicles as well as similar second-by-second trajectory level data from
naturalistic driving studies are becoming more available. In fact, neglecting mentioned impact
might lead to erroneous inferences due to the disparities in socioeconomic characteristics in
different regions. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, utilized multilevel logistic regression
modeling approach to evaluate the effect of driver's locality-related factors on driver speeding
behavior using naturalistic driving data collected from the SHRP2 project in six US states. The
results showed that the geographical location of drivers accounted for about 7.7% of the variability
in the likelihood of a driver driving over the posted speed, regardless of other explanatory
variables. The methodology and the results from this study can pave the road for future human
factor studies utilizing trajectory-level data from different geographical locations to reduce the
heterogeneity and increase the transferability of the results without introducing a bias in inferences. </td>

practitioners in railway transportation and engineering. This urges the necessity for a review of
recent research development in this field. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of
the recent applications of big data in the context of railway engineering and transportation by a
novel taxonomy framework, proposed by Mayring (2003). The survey covers three areas of
railway transportation where BDA has been applied, namely operations, maintenance and safety.
Also, the level of big data analytics, types of big data models and a variety of big data techniques
have been reviewed and summarized. The results of this study identify the existing research gaps
and thereby directions of future research in BDA in railway transportation systems </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The importance of maritime transport keeps increasing with the trade globalization. With the
growing demand for waterborne transport, vessel traffic flows are also expected to increase. This
paper reviews maritime traffic models from the vessel behavior modeling perspective. The maritime
traffic models include the models for vessel traffic both at sea and in confined water area. The aim of
this paper is to analyze the underlying modeling paradigms and to assess the extent in which
maritime traffic models can represent vessel behavior. Focusing on vessel behavior modeling, this
paper provides a broad overview of the current literature on maritime traffic models of the last
decades. The commercial models are not included due to the limit of information. To compare the
capabilities of models in capturing the vessel behavior characteristics, the considered models are
assessed from different aspects of vessel behavior representation, external impact modeling, and
model applicability. The assessment shows that none of the existing models describe all dynamic
kinetic information in detail for different vessels and consider the impacts from a full range of
external factors, which is possibly due to the specific purpose when the models were developed. The
models developed for specific vessels in specific situations ignore the irrespective behavioral details
in other possible scenarios. Models without proper calibration and validation limit the applicability
in other cases. It also indicates that few models can accurately simulate the different vessel behavior
at a microscopic level. To investigate the possible potential and limitations, the models have been
assessed and discussed to indicate the underlying modeling paradigms based on the modeling
characteristics. Future developments can focus on the behavior of different vessels in different types
of water areas and the corresponding impacts from external conditions (e.g. visibility, wind, current),
vessel encounters and traffic rules. Through calibration and validation, future models should
be able to fit the vessel behavior in real-life situations. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2015 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In this paper, we focus on a special problem in transportation studies that concerns the so
called ‘‘Big Data’’ challenge, which is: how to build concise yet accurate traffic flow prediction
models based on the massive data collected by different sensors? The size of the data, the hidden
causal dependence and the complexity of traffic time series are some of the obstacles
that affect making reliable forecast at a reasonable cost, both time-wise and computation wise.
To better prepare the data for traffic modeling, we introduce a multiple-step strategy
to process the raw ‘‘Big Data’’ into compact time series that are better suited for regression
and causality analysis. First, we use the Granger causality to define and determine the
potential dependence among data, and produce a much condensed set of times series
who are also highly dependent. Next, we deploy a decomposition algorithm to separate
daily-similar trend and nonstationary bursts components from the traffic flow time series
yielded by the Granger test. The decomposition results are then treated by two rounds of
Lasso regression: the standard Lasso method is first used to quickly filter out most of the
irrelevant data, followed by a robust Lasso method to further remove the disturbance
caused by bursts components and recover the strongest dependence among the remaining
data. Test results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the costs of building
prediction models. Moreover, the obtained causal dependence graph reveals the relationship
between the structure of road networks and the correlations among traffic time series.
All these findings are useful for building better traffic flow prediction models. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Big data from floating cars supply a frequent, ubiquitous sampling of traffic conditions on
the road network and provide great opportunities for enhanced short-term traffic predictions
based on real-time information on the whole network. Two network-based machine
learning models, a Bayesian network and a neural network, are formulated with a double
star framework that reflects time and space correlation among traffic variables and because
of its modular structure is suitable for an automatic implementation on large road networks.
Among different mono-dimensional time-series models, a seasonal autoregressive
moving average model (SARMA) is selected for comparison. The time-series model is also
used in a hybrid modeling framework to provide the Bayesian network with an a priori
estimation of the predicted speed, which is then corrected exploiting the information collected
on other links. A large floating car data set on a sub-area of the road network of
Rome is used for validation. To account for the variable accuracy of the speed estimated
from floating car data, a new error indicator is introduced that relates accuracy of prediction
to accuracy of measure. Validation results highlighted that the spatial architecture of
the Bayesian network is advantageous in standard conditions, where a priori knowledge is
more significant, while mono-dimensional time series revealed to be more valuable in the
few cases of non-recurrent congestion conditions observed in the data set. The results
obtained suggested introducing a supervisor framework that selects the most suitable prediction
depending on the detected traffic regimes. </td>

Ubiquitous mobile computing and the massive data it generates presents new
opportunities to measure the demand for this infrastructure, diagnose problems, and plan
for the future. However, before these benefits can be realized, methods and models must be
updated to integrate these new data sources into existing urban and transportation planning
frameworks for estimating travel demand and infrastructure usage. While recent
work has made great progress extracting valid and useful measurements from new data
resources, few present end-to-end solutions that transform and integrate raw, massive
data into estimates of travel demand and infrastructure performance. Here we present a
flexible, modular, and computationally efficient software system to fill this gap. Our system
estimates multiple aspects of travel demand using call detail records (CDRs) from mobile
phones in conjunction with open- and crowdsourced geospatial data, census records,
and surveys. We bring together numerous existing and new algorithms to generate representative
origin–destination matrices, route trips through road networks constructed using
open and crowd-sourced data repositories, and perform analytics on the system’s output.
We also present an online, interactive visualization platform to communicate these results
to researchers, policy makers, and the public. We demonstrate the flexibility of this system
by performing analyses on multiple cities around the globe. We hope this work will serve
as unified and comprehensive guide to integrating new big data resources into customary

in China in the early 2017. Without docking stations, this system allows the sharing bike to be
parked in any proper places. This study aimed to develop a dynamic demand forecasting model
for station-free bike sharing using the deep learning approach. The spatial and temporal analyses
were first conducted to investigate the mobility pattern of the station-free bike sharing. The result
indicates the imbalanced spatial and temporal demand of bike sharing trips. The long short-term
memory neural networks (LSTM NNs) were then developed to predict the bike sharing trip
production and attraction at TAZ for different time intervals, including the 10-min, 15-min, 20-
min and 30-min intervals. The validation results suggested that the developed LSTM NNs have
reasonable good prediction accuracy in trip productions and attractions for different time intervals.
The statistical models and recently developed machine learning methods were also developed
to benchmark the LSTM NN. The comparison results suggested that the LSTM NNs
provide better prediction accuracy than both conventional statistical models and advanced machine
learning methods for different time intervals. The developed LSTM NNs can be used to
predict the gap between the inflow and outflow of the sharing bike trips at a TAZ, which provide
useful information for rebalancing the sharing bike in the system. </td>

a classical, widely adopted procedure in transport engineering, both in off-line and in online
contexts. Notwithstanding numerous approaches proposed in the literature, there is
still room for considerable improvements, also leveraging the unprecedented opportunity
offered by information and communication technologies and big data. A key issue relates to
the unobservability of OD flows in real networks – except from closed highway systems –
thus leading to inherent difficulties in measuring performance of OD flows estimation/
updating methods and algorithms. Starting from these premises, the paper proposes a
common evaluation and benchmarking framework, providing a synthetic test bed, which
enables implementation and comparison of OD estimation/updating algorithms and
methodologies under ‘‘standardized” conditions. The framework, implemented in a platform
available to interested parties upon request, has been flexibly designed and allows
comparing a variety of approaches under various settings and conditions. Specifically,
the structure and the key features of the framework are presented, along with a detailed
experimental design for the application of different dynamic OD flow estimation algorithms.
By way of example, applications to both off-line/planning and on-line algorithms

promising source of information for analysis of traffic problems. To date, research on
insights and information to be gleaned from CDR data for transportation analysis has been
slow, and there has been little progress on development of specific applications. This paper
proposes the traffic semantic concept to extract traffic commuters’ origins and destinations
information from the mobile phone CDR data and then use the extracted data for traffic
zone division. A K-means clustering method was used to classify a cell-area (the area covered
by a base stations) and tag a certain land use category or traffic semantic attribute
(such as working, residential, or urban road) based on four feature data (including
real-time user volume, inflow, outflow, and incremental flow) extracted from the CDR data.
By combining the geographic information of mobile phone base stations, the roadway network
within Beijing’s Sixth Ring Road was divided into a total of 73 traffic zones using
another K-means clustering algorithm. Additionally, we proposed a traffic zone
attribute-index to measure tendency of traffic zones to be residential or working. The calculated
attribute-index values of 73 traffic zones in Beijing were consistent with the actual
traffic and land-use data. The case study demonstrates that effective traffic and travel data
can be obtained from mobile phones as portable sensors and base stations as fixed sensors,
providing an opportunity to improve the analysis of complex travel patterns and behaviors
for travel demand modeling and transportation planning. </td>

analysis (refer to analyzing trajectory datasets) for on-demand services in this paper. Our purposes
are at least trifold. First, we highlight the value of trajectory data in understanding on-demand
services and discuss the procedures of retrieving information for the demand part and
the supply part from raw trajectory data. Second, we categorize related studies into three parts
(the demand part, the supply part, and the mixed part) and review the significant findings. For
the demand part, we focus on the models proposed for describing and explaining the spatial temporal
characteristics of observed trips. Methods or models proposed for describing trip statistics,
scaling laws of trips, and dynamics of ridership are reviewed. We summarize four types of
factors that influence the spatial-temporal patterns of demands. For the supply part, we focus on
the models proposed for describing the spatial-temporal characteristics of available taxis/ridesharing
cars and modeling the behavior of drivers (i.e., passenger-search behavior and route
choice behavior) to explain the spatial-temporal patterns of taxi/ride-sharing supplies. For the
mixed part, we focus on studies that apply the uncovered demands/supplies patterns to design

technique to analyze large-scale geo-location data from social media to infer individual
activity patterns. A data-driven modeling approach, based on topic modeling, is proposed
to classify patterns in individual activity choices. The model provides an activity generation
mechanism which when combined with the data from traditional surveys is potentially a
useful component of an activity-travel simulator. Using the model, aggregate patterns
of users’ weekly activities are extracted from the data. The model is extended to also find
user-specific activity patterns. We extend the model to account for missing activities
(a major limitation of social media data) and demonstrate how information from
activity-based diaries can be complemented with longitudinal geo-location information.

GPS trajectory data are also rapidly expanding. Big GPS trajectory data analytics offers new
opportunities for gaining insights into vehicle movement dynamics and road network usage
patterns that are important for transportation studies and urban planning among other fields.
Processing big GPS trajectory data, consisting of billions of GPS waypoints and millions of individual
trajectories is a challenging yet important task for researchers from these different
domains. In this research, we propose an Apache Spark-based geo-computing framework for
using big GPS trajectory data to estimate vehicle miles travelled, an important metric used by
both federal and state highway agencies in the United States for transportation planning. The
computing challenge lies in scaling the processing of billions of raw GPS points data as well as the
steps for map matching for a statewide road network consisting of thousands of road segments. In
this work, we develop a scalable map-matching module that considers both the spatiotemporal
information of GPS waypoint sequences and topologic information of road network for the State
of Maryland while striking a balance between matching accuracy and computing time. We
processed 19.8 million raw GPS trips consisting of approximately 1.4 billion GPS waypoints
collected in Maryland during a four-month period in 2015 to estimate vehicle miles travelled for
Maryland’s road network. The estimation results show that using big GPS trajectory analytic

for traffic safety, energy consumption and emissions. How to quantify the extent of
calm or volatile driving and explore its correlates is a key research question investigated
in the study. This study contributes by leveraging a large-scale behavioral database to analyze
short-term driving decisions and develop a new driver volatility index to measure the
extent of variations in driving. The index captures variation in driving behavior constrained
by the performance of the vehicle from a decision-making perspective. Specifically, instantaneous
driving decisions include maintaining speed, accelerating, decelerating, maintaining
acceleration/deceleration, or jerks to vehicle, i.e., the decision to change marginal rate
of acceleration or deceleration. A fundamental understanding of instantaneous driving
behavior is developed by categorizing vehicular jerk reversals (acceleration followed by
deceleration), jerk enhancements (increasing accelerations or decelerations), and jerk mitigations
(decreasing accelerations or decelerations). Volatility in driving decisions, captured
by jerky movements, is quantified using data collected in Atlanta, GA during 2011.
The database contains 51,370 trips and their associated second-by-second speed data,
totaling 36 million seconds. Rigorous statistical models explore correlates of volatility that
include socioeconomic variables, travel context variables, and vehicle types. The study contributes

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A number of studies in the last decade have argued that Global Positioning Systems (GPS)
based survey offer the potential to replace traditional travel diary surveys. GPS-based
surveys impose lower respondent burden, offer greater spatiotemporal precision and incur
fewer monetary costs. However, GPS-based surveys do not collect certain key inputs
required for the estimation of travel demand models, such as the travel mode(s) taken
or the trip purpose, relying instead on data-processing procedures to infer this information.
This study assesses the impact that errors in inference can have on travel demand models
estimated using data from GPS-based surveys and proposes ways in which these errors can
be controlled for during both data collection and model estimation. We use simulated
datasets to compare performance across different sample sizes, inference accuracies, model
complexities and estimation methods. Findings from the simulated datasets are
corroborated with real data collected from individuals living in the San Francisco Bay
Area, United States. Results indicate that the benefits of using GPS-based surveys will vary
significantly, depending upon the sample size of the data, the accuracy of the inference
algorithm and the desired complexity of the travel demand model specification. In many
cases, gains in the volume of data that can potentially be retrieved using GPS devices are
found to be offset by the loss in quality caused by inaccuracies in inference. This study
makes the argument that passively collected GPS-based surveys may never entirely replace
surveys that require active interaction with study participants. </td>

We developed an innovative big data approach to derive street-level morphology and urban feature
composition as experienced by a pedestrian from Google Street View (GSV) imagery. We employed a scalable deep
learning framework to segment 90-degree field of view GSV image cubes into six classes: sky, trees, buildings,
impervious surfaces, pervious surfaces, and non-permanent objects. We increased the classification accuracy by
differentiating between three view directions (lateral, down, and up) and by introducing a void class as training
label. To model the urban environment as perceived by a pedestrian in a street canyon, we projected the segmented
image cubes onto spheres and evaluated the fraction of each surface class on the sphere. To demonstrate the
application of our approach, we analyzed the urban form and composition of Philadelphia County and three
Philadelphia neighborhoods (suburb, center city, lower income neighborhood) using stacked area graphs. Our

of being urban land, which is validated by 30-m higher resolution references. We also quantified the minimum
and maximum urban areas in 2000 for each country/continent based on subjective probability thresholds (i.e.,
0.9 and 0.1) on our hybrid urban map. Globally, we estimated that the urban land area was between 377,000
and 533,000 km2 in 2000. The credible interval of minimum/maximum urban area can help guide future studies
in estimating urban areas. In addition to providing uncertainty information, the hybrid map also achieves higher
accuracy than individual maps when it is converted into a binary urban/non-urban map using a probability
threshold of 0.5. This new method has the ability to further integrate discrete site/location-based data, local,
regional, and global urban land maps. As more data is sequentially integrated, the accuracy is expected to
improve. Therefore, our hybrid map should not be regarded as a final product, but a new prior product for future
synthesis and integration toward a “big data” solution. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This study aims to explore the economic impacts of urban open spaces using the sales data of local small
businesses. A new urban park could attract more visitors and lead to neighborhood revitalization, especially in
distressed neighborhoods. In order to explore this mechanism, this study analyzes the case of the Gyeongui Line
Forest Park, a previously underutilized railroad that was converted to a linear urban park. A difference-indifference
approach was applied to evaluate the change in the sales of local businesses before and after the park’s
opening using credit card and cash sales data provided by the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s Big Data
Campus. The results showed that urban linear parks could have positive effects that lead to the neighborhoods’
economic vitality. However, the economic impacts could vary depending on neighborhood contexts. Specifically,
economically distressed neighborhoods could benefit more from the opening of a park. This study directly
captured the revitalization impact of the Gyeongui Line Forest Park using actual sales data instead of analyzing
indirect outcomes such as property values, thereby providing an alternative approach to measure the economic
impacts of parks. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Outdoor recreation as a cultural ecosystem service offers an important opportunity for many people to experience directly the benefits that ecosystems provide, particularly in urban areas. The recent emergence of social media and other sources of ‘big data’ creates exciting alternative possibilities for assessing how people use nature for recreational purposes. In this study, we focus on ‘geocaching’, a worldwide outdoor game in which the participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to hide and seek containers called ‘geocaches.’ We use the city of Leipzig (Germany) as a case study and focus on nature-related geocaches to explore short-term recreation as a cultural ecosystem service. We use georeferenced localities of geocaches and their visit rates as quantitative measures and combine them with a content analysis, as well as with quantitative results of an online survey. Using this data, we distinguish between revealed and stated preferences. We found that the density of geocaches was highest close to the city centre and that geocaching is indeed a type of local recreation and an urban ecosystem service, as green areas and experiences in nature are important for this activity. Stated and revealed preferences, however, often did not match for the different types of geocaches that we identified. While geocachers may have quite different motivations, the activity appears to be mostly done by young, well-educated people according to our surveys. In summary, geocaching data offer exciting opportunities to explore spatial gradients, as well as preferences and motivations regarding short-term recreation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2015 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In recent years, geospatial design (or geodesign) has emerged as an area of technological development,
GIScience research, and design practice. With Esri leading the branding of this emerging area, geospatial
technology developers, design consultancies, and academic units are recognizing the affordances of
applying geovisualization and geoanalytical techniques to more conventional practices within design and
planning fields. Additionally, the GISciences are being called to rearticulate their research agendas in the
face of ‘big data’ and neogeography. This paper examines these developments with regard to criticality, or
the ways in which mapping practices are applied in critical research – both research that seeks to situate
the emergence of geospatial technologies and enrolls these technologies more directly as method. What
is the criticality of mapping practices amid these developments? More specifically to the design and
planning fields, how might geodesign align with critical GIS? I take up these questions by tracing three
presuppositions of criticality in mapping while examining the conditions of geodesign’s emergence: representation
and futurity, neutrality and efficacy, and relationality and complexity. I conclude by outlining
a research agenda for further advancement of a critical geodesign. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Quantifying park use and understanding its driving factors is crucially important for increasing park use and thus
human well-being. Previous studies have investigated the effects of different physical and sociocultural factors
on park usage using visitor surveys and direct observations of park users, which are usually site specific and time
consuming. We quantified and compared the number of visits for different types of parks in Beijing using freely
available geotagged check-in data from social media. We investigated how park attributes, park location, park
context and public transportation affected the number of park check-in visits, using multiple linear regressions.
Despite potential biases in the use of social media data, using a park typology, we found that the number of visits
was significantly different among different types of parks. While cultural relics parks and large urban parks had
larger numbers of visits, neighborhood parks had higher visitation rates per unit of area. Park size and entrance
fees were associated with increased numbers of visits for all types of parks. For parks that mainly serve local
residents, the distance to urban center significantly affected park use. The number of bus stops was positively
correlated with park visits, suggesting that increased accessibility through public transportation leads to more
visits. The results indicated that improving park accessibility via public transportation and planning small, accessible
green spaces in residential areas were effective in improving park use. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Big data is increasingly seen as a way of providing a more ‘scientific’ approach to the understanding and
management of cities. But most geographic analyses of geotagged social media data have failed to mobilize
a sufficiently complex understanding of socio-spatial relations. By combining the conceptual approach
of relational socio-spatial theory with the methods of critical GIScience, this paper explores the spatial
imaginaries and processes of segregation and mobility at play in the notion of the ‘9th Street Divide’ in
Louisville, Kentucky. Through a more context-sensitive analysis of this data, this paper argues against this
popular spatial imaginary and the notion that the Louisville’s West End is somehow separate and apart
from the rest of the city. By analyzing the everyday activity spaces of different groups of Louisvillians
through geotagged Twitter data, we instead argue for an understanding of these neighborhoods as fluid,
porous and actively produced, rather than as rigid, static or fixed. Ultimately, this paper is meant to
provide a conceptual and methodological framework for the analysis of social media data that is more
attentive to the multiplicity of socio-spatial relations embodied in such data. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper proposes a double time-scale model to capture the day-to-day evolution along with the within-day variability of travel time. The proposed model can be used to evaluate short-term to long-term effects of new transport policies and construction of critical infrastructures, and to analyze the resilience of road networks under disruptions. The within-day travel time variability is modeled using the functional data analysis, in which the effects of road traffic congestion and noise of traffic data are considered explicitly. The within-day process is then regarded as the local volatility (or the noise process) to drive the day-to-day process while the latter is described by a modified geometric Brownian motion (GBM). Then, the day-to-day travel time process is obtained by the statistics of the modified GBM. The model probabilistically captures the evolution of day-to-day and within-day travel time processes analytically. Moreover, an efficient method based on the cross-entropy method is developed for calibrating the model parameters. A lasso-like reg- ularization is employed to guarantee a small bias between the model estimations and the measurement counterparts. Finally, two empirical studies are carried out to validate the proposed model at different scales with different traffic scenarios, i.e., a case study on the Guangzhou Airport Expressway (link to path scale) under traffic accident conditions and a case study in New York City (city-scale) to analyze the network resilience under Hurricane Sandy. Both case studies adopted probe vehicle data but with different configurations (fine versus coarse, small versus big data). The empirical studies confirm that the proposed model can accommodate the inherent variability in traffic conditions and data meanwhile being computationally tractable. The numerical results illustrate the applicability of the proposed model as a powerful tool in practice for analyzing the short-term and long-term impacts of disruptions and systematic changes in the performance of road networks. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2015 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper formulates a generalized heterogeneous data model (GHDM) that jointly handles
mixed types of dependent variables—including multiple nominal outcomes, multiple
ordinal variables, and multiple count variables, as well as multiple continuous variables—
by representing the covariance relationships among them through a reduced number
of latent factors. Sufficiency conditions for identification of the GHDM parameters are
presented. The maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) method is
proposed to estimate this jointly mixed model system. This estimation method provides
computational time advantages since the dimensionality of integration in the likelihood
function is independent of the number of latent factors. The study undertakes a simulation
experiment within the virtual context of integrating residential location choice and travel
behavior to evaluate the ability of the MACML approach to recover parameters. The simulation
results show that the MACML approach effectively recovers underlying parameters,
and also that ignoring the multi-dimensional nature of the relationship among mixed types
of dependent variables can lead not only to inconsistent parameter estimation, but also
have important implications for policy analysis. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Mohammadreza Saeedmanesh, Nikolas Geroliminis </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Aggregated network level modeling and control of traffic in urban networks have recently gained a lot of interest due to unpredictability of travel behaviors and high complexity of physical modeling in microscopic level. Recent research has shown the existence of well-defined Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFDs) relating average flow and density in homogeneous networks. The concept of MFD allows to design real-time traffic control schemes specifically hierarchical perimeter control approaches to alleviate or postpone congestion. Considering the fact that congestion is spatially correlated in adjacent roads and it propagates spatiotemporaly with finite speed, describing the main pockets of congestion in a heterogeneous city with small number of clusters is conceivable. In this paper, we propose a three-step clustering algorithm to partition heterogeneous networks into connected homogeneous regions, which makes the application of perimeter control feasible. The advantages of the proposed method compared to the existing ones are the ability of finding directional congestion within a cluster, robustness with respect to parameters calibration, and its good performance for networks with low connectivity and missing data. Firstly, we start to find a connected homogeneous area around each road of the network in an iterative way (i.e. it forms a sequence of roads). Each sequence of roads, defined as ‘snake’, is built by starting from a single road and iteratively adding one adjacent road based on its similarity to join previously added roads in that sequence. Secondly, based on the obtained sequences from the first step, a similarity measure is defined between each pair of the roads in the network. The similarities are computed in a way that put more weight on neighboring roads and facilitate connectivity of the clusters. Finally, Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) framework is utilized to assign roads to proper clusters with high intra-similarity and low inter-similarity. SNMF partitions the data by providing a lower rank approximation of the similarity matrix. The proposed clustering framework is applied in medium and large-size networks based on micro-simulation and empirical data from probe vehicles. In addition, the extension of the algorithm is proposed to deal with the networks with sparse measurements where information of some links is missing. The results show the effectiveness and robustness of the extended algorithm applied to simulated network under different penetration rates (percentage of links with data). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Analysis of GPS traces shows that people often do not use the least cost path through the transportation network while making trips. This leads to the question which structural path characteristics can be used to construct realistic route choice sets for use in traffic simulation models. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that, for utilitarian trips, the route between origin and destination consists of a small number of concatenated least cost paths. The hypothesis is verified by analyzing routes extracted from large sets of recorded GPS traces which constitute revealed preference information. Trips have been extracted from the traces and for each trip the path in the transportation network is determined by map matching. This is followed by a path decomposition phase for which the algorithm constitutes the first contribution of this paper. There are multiple ways to split a given path in a directed graph into a minimal number of subpaths of minimal cost. By calculating two specific path splittings, it is possible to identify subsets of the vertices ( splitVertexSuites ) that can be used to generate every possible minimum path splitting by taking one vertex from each such subset. As a second contribution, we show how the extracted information is used in microscopic travel simulation. The distribution for the size of the minimum decomposition, extracted from the GPS traces, can be used in constrained enumeration methods for route choice set generation. The sets of vertices that can act as boundary vertices separating consecutive route parts contain way points (landmarks) having a particular meaning to their user. The paper explains the theoretical aspects of route splitting as well as the process to extract splitVertexSuite s from big data. It reports statistical distributions extracted from sets of GPS traces for both multimodal person movements and unimodal car trips. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We propose a dynamic factor model to forecast traffic state for groups of locations. The model decomposes the grouped traffic time series into the latent common factor component and idiosyncratic component. It uses a few latent factor series to represent the comovement of the underlying dynamics of grouped traffic flows, and idiosyncratic component to represent location-specific traffic characteristics. The dynamic factor model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method via an iterative EM (expectation maximization) algorithm. The traffic state forecast for each location is a combination of the respective forecast from the common factor component and idiosyncratic component. The dynamic factor model exhibits four advantages. It provides an excellent way to (1) seamlessly incorporate spatial correlations among grouped traffic flows into forecast; (2) produce forecast simultaneously for group locations; (3) perform dimension reduction such that high-dimension grouped traffic time series can be modeled at a low-dimension space; (4) consider not only location-specific information but also global common dynamics in the forecast. Meanwhile, it also has capacity to accommodate typical characteristics of traffic flows including temporal correlation, seasonality, structural change in mean and/or covariance function, and cointegration. Forecast accuracy is significantly improved across highway network as well as urban road network in comparison with the Sparse VAR and ARIMA models. The proposed method is suitable for large-scale network traffic forecast in the context of big data environment. This research provides sufficient evidence that justified the importance and efficacy of spatial correlation for predictive accuracy and attempts to fill the gaps in literature of traffic forecast for groups of locations. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> With more connected vehicles (CVs) in the networks, the big data era leads to the availability of abundant data from CVs. CV penetration rate is the fundamental building block of tremendous applications, such as traffic data estimation, CV-based adaptive signal control and origin-destination estimation. While CV penetration rate is a random variable unknown in nature, the current estimation method of penetration rate mainly relies on two sources of data —detector and CV data. Penetration rate across the link is computed as CV flow divided by all traffic flow over a certain period of time. However, the current method is constrained by availability and quality of detector data. This paper proposes a simple, analytical, non-parametric, and most importantly, unbiased single-source data penetration rate (SSDPR) estimation method for estimating penetration rate solely based on CV data. It subtly and simultaneously fuses two estimation mechanisms—(1) the measurement of the probability of the first vehicle in a queue being a CV and (2) the direct estimation of the penetration rate of a sample queue—to constitute a single estimator to handle all the possible sample queue patterns. Applicability of the proposed method is not confined to a specific arrival pattern. It solely utilizes the number of the observed CVs and the number of vehicles before the last observed CV in a sample queue. Combining with bridging the queue algorithm, the proposed SSDPR estimation method is extended to overflow or oversaturated conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed method is able to accurately estimate penetration rate as low as 0.1% for all the situations considered. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed method, a case study of fundamental diagram estimation of a link without being installed with any detector is presented. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper proposes a big-data analytics-based approach that considers social media
(Twitter) data for the identification of supply chain management issues in food industries.
In particular, the proposed approach includes text analysis using a support vector machine
(SVM) and hierarchical clustering with multiscale bootstrap resampling. The result of this
approach included a cluster of words which could inform supply-chain (SC) decision makers
about customer feedback and issues in the flow/quality of food products. A case study
in the beef supply chain was analysed using the proposed approach, where three weeks of
data from Twitter were used. </td>

(BDA) capabilities to improve their performance. However, past literature on BDA have
put limited focus on understanding the capabilities required to extract value from big data.
In this context, this paper aims to provide a systematic literature review of BDA capabilities

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Field-relevant reference driving cycles, equivalent to real-life operation, are a prerequisite
for the consistent development and testing of vehicles, their components, and control algorithms.
Furthermore they are the basis for certification and type testing. However, a static
cycle can easily be detected during vehicle testing, so that optimized control parameters
could be used to obtain improved emission results under test conditions. In this paper, a
novel method is described and applied to generate a dynamic driving cycle that statistically
matches the real-life operation of a vehicle. The analysis is performed based on an extensive
field data set obtained during an automated measurement campaign of public busses
for more than a full year with 27,365 h of operation and 315,583 km driven in the city of
Hamburg (Germany). The data collected is statistically compared to the static reference
cycles New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and Worldwide harmonized Light Vehicles
Test Procedure (WLTP). Two micro trip models with increasing complexity are described
and fit to the data set. All models are quantitatively compared to the measured data set
applying a Quality of Fit (QoF) indicator. Based on the highest consistency to field data, a
non-deterministic driving cycle generator is developed and its output is statistically compared
to the original measurement. In contrast to the existing reference cycles, the
dynamic output of the non-deterministic driving cycle generator presented in this paper
is statistically proven to be consistent with real-life operation of public busses in the urban
environment of Hamburg. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Analyzing the factors that affect the energy efficiency of vehicles is crucial to the overall
improvement of the environmental efficiency of the transport sector, one of the top polluting
sectors at the global level. This study analyses the energy consumption rate (ECR) and
driving range of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and provides insight into the factors that
affect their energy consumption by harnessing big data from real-world driving. The analysis
relied on four data sources: (i) driving patterns collected from 741 drivers over a two year
period; (ii) drivers’ characteristics; (iii) road type; (iv) weather conditions. The results
of the analysis measure the mean ECR of BEVs at 0.183 kW h/km, underline a 34% increase
in ECR and a 25% decrease in driving range in the winter with respect to the summer, and
suggest the electricity tariff for BEVs to be cost efficient with respect to conventional ones.
Moreover, the results of the analysis show that driving speed, acceleration and temperature
have non-linear effects on the ECR, while season and precipitation level have a strong
linear effect. The econometric model of the ECR of BEVs suggests that the optimal driving
speed is between 45 and 56 km/h and the ideal temperature from an energy efficiency perspective
is 14  C. Clearly, the performance of BEVs highly depends on the driving environment,
the driving patterns, and the weather conditions, and the findings from this study
enlighten the consumers to be more informed and manufacturers to be more aware about
the actual utilization of BEVs. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Various regulations are imposed on shipping to increase energy efficiency and reduce environmental
impacts. Alternative fuels and power systems are among the solutions for compliance with
these regulations. The power system of a ship may not operate optimally because of the diversity
of the operational profile during its lifetime. This article uses an activity-based approach and big
data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to study the operational profiles of eight ship
types operating in Norwegian waters around mainland Norway in 2016. The aim is to identify
ship types that can benefit from electric and hybrid propulsion through analysis of their operational
profiles. Close to shore, the operational profiles of various ship types are similar, and all
ships spend a great proportion of their time with lower loads. As the distance from shore increases,
the operational profiles of various ship types follow distinct trends. Among the considered
ship types, reefers spend more operational time close to the diesel engine design condition.
On the other hand, offshore and passenger ships show the most dynamic operational
profiles and spend a large percentage of their operational time with a partial load, away from
diesel engine design conditions. Such ships can benefit from hybridisation, diesel-electric propulsion,
and other electric concepts, such as batteries and fuel cells. Another option is to
downsize diesel engines for better operation while fuel cells and batteries supply peak and partial
loads. Operational profiles are plotted and details of the approach are presented in the article. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper presents a modeling and simulation study of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of
plug-in vehicles subject to real-world driving conditions. The simulations utilize open-source
software tools for estimation of second-by-second energy and/or fuel consumption in more than
65 thousand real-world recorded trips in the California household travel survey (CHTS) data set.
Statistical distributions of the equivalent well-to-wheels (W2W) GHG emissions corresponding to
CHTS trips are generated for three baseline public-domain plug-in vehicle models of: (i) parallel drive
plug-in hybrid, (ii) serial-drive plug-in hybrid, and (iii) pure electric vehicle. In addition to
the baseline models, several derived vehicle models are created by upsizing of the battery and
powertrain via an iterative procedure to attain the new all-electric range (AER). The emissions
model also considers days when a pure electric vehicle cannot meet the travel demand by assuming
that the driving on those days is done on a conventional vehicle. For each of the considered
powertrain architectures, optimizing the AER for minimum GHG emissions becomes a
trade-off between reducing the gasoline driven miles and maintaining reasonably sized (lightweight)
powertrain components. As such, the equivalent GHG emissions of a vehicle are shown to
have diminishing returns in terms of AER, and the optimum AER depends on both the carbon
content in the electric grid, as well as the charging behavior. Within considered modeling assumptions
and several vehicle usage conditions, the optimum AER is estimated to be between 30
and 60 miles for PHEVs, and between 120 and 200 miles for BEVs. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Charging infrastructure is critical to the development of electric vehicle (EV) system. While
many countries have implemented great policy efforts to promote EVs, how to build charging
infrastructure to maximize overall travel electrification given how people travel has not
been well studied. Mismatch of demand and infrastructure can lead to under-utilized
charging stations, wasting public resources. Estimating charging demand has been challenging
due to lack of realistic vehicle travel data. Public charging is different from refueling
from two aspects: required time and home-charging possibility. As a result, traditional
approaches for refueling demand estimation (e.g. traffic flow and vehicle ownership density)
do not necessarily represent public charging demand. This research uses large-scale
trajectory data of 11,880 taxis in Beijing as a case study to evaluate how travel patterns
mined from big-data can inform public charging infrastructure development. Although this
study assumes charging stations to be dedicated to a fleet of PHEV taxis which may not
fully represent the real-world situation, the methodological framework can be used to analyze
private vehicle trajectory data as well to improve our understanding of charging
demand for electrified private fleet. Our results show that (1) collective vehicle parking
‘‘hotspots’’ are good indicators for charging demand; (2) charging stations sited using travel
patterns can improve electrification rate and reduce gasoline consumption; (3) with
current grid mix, emissions of CO2, PM, SO2, and NOx will increase with taxi electrification;
and (4) power demand for public taxi charging has peak load around noon, overlapping
with Beijing’s summer peak power. </td>

the travel time uncertainty impacts on the equity of individual accessibility. Travel time distributions
of the road network and mobility data for a large number of individual samples across

mobile phone tracking data. Two reliability-based individual accessibility measures are proposed
to evaluate individual accessibility by explicitly considering individual’s on-time arrival probability
concern for activity participations. The proposed measures are further applied to quantify
travel time uncertainty impacts on the equity of individual accessibility to shopping services.
Results of this study demonstrate the capabilities of using spatiotemporal big data to examine the
equity of accessibility in a disaggregated individual level. The results also suggest that travel time
uncertainties have negative impacts on accessibility of all people groups, but more serious impacts
on disadvantaged people groups with a lower accessibility level. </td>

for the United Kingdom and evaluates the need for further calibration of the model. The
study focuses on HGVs and compares estimates made by HDM-4 to measurements from a large
fleet of vehicles driving on motorways in England. The data was obtained from the telematic
database of truck fleet managers (SAE J1939) and includes three types of HGVs: light, medium
and heavy trucks. Some 19,991 records from 1645 trucks are available in total. These represent
records of trucks driving at constant speed along part of the M1 and the M18, two motorways in
England.
These conditions have been simulated in HDM-4 by computing fuel consumption for each
truck type driving at a constant speed of 85 km/h on a flat and straight road segment in good
condition.
Estimates are compared to real measurements under two separate sets of assumptions. First,
the HDM-4 model calibrated for the UK has been used. Then, the model was updated to take into
account vehicle weight and frontal area specific to the considered vehicles.
The paper shows that the current calibration of HDM-4 for the United Kingdom already requires
recalibration. The quality of the model estimates can be improved significantly by updating
vehicle weight and frontal area in HDM-4. The use of HGV fleet and network condition
data as described in this paper provides an opportunity to verify HDM-4 continuously. </td>

which is considered to be the third most important in Spain, having a population of nearly 800,000 inhabitants
and a size of 135 km2. The concepts of a specific event map and a specific event map with positive or negative

heat map of a specific day from the mean daily heat map, which is obtained by taking into account the 365 days

This paper demonstrates how the proposed analysis from tweets can be used to depict city events and discover
their spatiotemporal characteristics. Finally, the combination of all daily specific events maps in a single map,

group of activities, most researchers tend to utilise one temporal attribute when representing time use of activities.
Thus, temporal pattern of activities is usually visualised and understood as a profile of various observations
listed sequentially over time. This paper aims to investigate the temporal pattern of activities in urban
areas from a new perspective. Temporal pattern is visualised and analysed as the distribution of activity points in
a two-dimensional temporal plane defined by the start and end time of activities as x and y axes. Kernel density
estimation is used as a typical method to observe the temporal pattern of activities in Shanghai based on a one week
smart card dataset generated in the Shanghai's metro system. The results show that the proposed perspective
can reveal considerably more information regarding the temporal pattern than a conventional one can. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Urban development requires the support of its surrounding areas. Accurate identification of urban hinterlands
can help to scientifically evaluate strength and potential of urban development. The field strength model is
regarded as an effective way to identify hinterlands, but the revision of friction coefficient has still not reached a
consensus. With the application of big data in urban planning, it is possible to improve the field strength model.
Toponym co–occurrence data, as a timely data source directly obtained from the Internet, can be used to reflect
the spatiotemporal changes in urban connections, and provide an approach to quantifying the friction coefficient
for the division of urban hinterlands. In this study, a new approach was developed by integrating toponym
co–occurrence and improved field strength model. We considered the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration as a
case and identified the urban hinterland of each city. The results showed that the friction coefficient among cities
fluctuated within a range of 1.25–2.50, the urban hinterlands were no longer confined to their own administrative
divisions, and there was fierce competition with other cities. In particular, the urban hinterland of
Guangzhou was 3699 km2 larger than its actual administrative area. In addition, the proposed approach was
more reliable in urban hinterland identification compared with the traditional fixed friction coefficient method.
This study provides an improved field strength model based on toponym co–occurrence, which can identify
urban hinterlands more accurately and objectively as well as promote the application of big data in urban

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Despite a growing interest among policymakers and urban planners in promoting polycentric and compact
development to mitigate traffic congestion, empirical studies have often documented mixed and indirect evidence
on the impacts of polycentricity and compactness on congestion. Drawing upon a direct and big-databased
measure of congestion and gridded (1 km×1 km) population data of 98 Chinese cities, this study investigates
how polycentricity and compactness may affect congestion in these cities. The degrees of polycentricity
and compactness are measured through fine-grained identification of population centers. All else being
equal, the empirical results show that congestion is positively associated with the degree of compactness but
negatively associated with that of polycentricity. However, increasing the degree of polycentricity by developing
more than four population centers may also lead to more congestion. Furthermore, the negative impact of
polycentricity on congestion becomes weaker with the increase in a city's population and even turns positive for
large cities with more than six million inhabitants within urban districts. The paper concludes with spatial
planning implications. </td>

interact with. They are common to most urban dwellers. They also have various socioeconomic, sociopsychological
and public-policy implications, which have only been sporadically mentioned and/or examined in
existing studies across different disciplines. In this manuscript, we first summarize fragmental existing studies on
familiar strangers that are defined in the traditional manner based on “small data” such as survey responses.
Then we reconceptualize “familiar strangers” against the backdrop of the emergence and increased availability
of big and open data. Such familiar strangers are called “familiar strangers in the big data era” (FSiBDE). After
this, we have done the following: (a) synthesized and hypothesized factors influencing the distribution and
quantity of the FSiBDE; (b) conducted an empirical study in the context of Beijing to embody and operationalize
a special type of the FSiBDE among metro riders and to study its possible influencers. We find that across metro
stations, it is spatial structure, population distribution, and transport network that significantly influence the
count and odds of FSiBDE among millions of metro riders. In addition, the FSiBDE also can have important policy

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The problem associated with a city's administrative boundary being “under-bounded” or “over-bounded” has become a
global phenomenon. A city's administrative boundary city does not effectively represent the actual size and
impact of its labor force and economic activity. While many existing case studies have investigated the functional
urban areas of single cities, the problem of how to delineate urban areas in geographic space relating to large
bodies of cities or at the scale of an entire country has not been investigated. This study proposed a method for
FUA identification that relies on ride-hailing big data. In this study, over 43 million anonymized 2016 car-hailing
records were collected from Didi Chuxing, the largest car-hailing online platform in the world (to the best of our
knowledge). A core-periphery approach is then proposed that uses nationwide and fine-grained trips to understand
functional urban areas in Mainland China. This study examined 4456 out of all 39,007 townships in an
attempt to provide a new method for the definition of urban functional areas in Chinese Mainland. In addition,
four types of cities are identified using a comparison of functional urban areas with their administrative limits,
and a further evaluation is conducted using 23 Chinese urban agglomerations. With the rapidly increasing use of
internet-based ride-hailing services, such as Didi, Grab, Lyft, and Uber, globally, this study provides a practical
benchmark for the delineation of functional urban areas at larger scales. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Traffic congestion is one of the key issues relating to sustainability and livability in many large cities. In particular,
the situation in the growing megacities of developing countries has been worsening and is now attracting
considerable attention from researchers and politicians. An understanding of the spatio-temporal patterns of this
congestion is necessary in order to formulate effective policies to relieve it. Much of the research to date has
focused on single districts for relatively short periods (days or weeks) using GPS, while long-term analysis of
spatial and temporal patterns of traffic congestion at the city level has been rare. The aim of this paper is to help
fill this gap in the literature by applying a big data analytic approach to a sample of 10.16 million records of
traffic congestion indexes for 233 roads in the Beijing area over a six-month period. This analysis revealed four
typical traffic congestion patterns in Beijing, which can be described as the weekend mode, holiday mode,
weekday mode A, and weekday mode B. Each of these patterns possesses unique spatial and temporal characteristics.
Compared with working days, on which congestion is regular and agglomerated, weekends and
holidays are characterized by long-lasting congestion peaks throughout the day. Non-commuting travel on
weekends and holidays, including trips for tourism, shopping, entertainment, and children's after-school activities,
are major contributors to traffic congestion of the weekend and holiday mode. Owing to poor jobs-housing
balance, the suburban new towns and job centres had relatively higher congestion than other areas. These
findings shed significant light on geographical patterns of traffic congestion in growing megacities </td>

Olympic-related attention captures ~12.5% of the global twitter discourse during the event. In the English
language, Olympic cities receive a positive brand value from the Olympic Games, because positive tweets about
the Games and their prior, future, and bid cities exceed negative tweets at a ratio of 4:1. The Olympics leave no
long-term image-legacy on twitter to their hosts but attract significant positive attention to the future host city.
In contrast, the IOC attracts more negative than positive attention on twitter. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The things surrounding us vary dramatically, which implies that there are far more small things than
large ones, e.g., far more small cities than large ones in the world. This dramatic variation is often referred
to as fractal or scaling. To better reveal the fractal or scaling structure, a new classification scheme,
namely head/tail breaks, has been developed to recursively derive different classes or hierarchical levels.
The head/tail breaks works as such: divide things into a few large ones in the head (those above the average)
and many small ones (those below the average) in the tail, and recursively continue the dividing process
for the large ones (or the head) until the notion of far more small things than large ones has been
violated. This paper attempts to argue that head/tail breaks can be a powerful visualization tool for illustrating
structure and dynamics of natural cities. Natural cities refer to naturally or objectively defined
human settlements based on a meaningful cutoff averaged from a massive amount of units extracted
from geographic information. To illustrate the effectiveness of head/tail breaks in visualization, I have
developed several case studies applied to natural cities derived from the points of interest, social media
location data, and time series nighttime images. I further elaborate on head/tail breaks related to fractals,
beauty, and big data. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Since the 2000s, an era of big data has emerged. Since then, urban planners have increasingly applied the theory
and methods of big data in planning practice. Recent decades illustrate a rapid increase of the application of big
data approaches in transportation, bringing new opportunities for innovation in transport modeling. This article
analyzes the theories and methods of big data in traffic demand forecasting. In view of theory, the new models
and algorithms are proposed in order to adapt to new big data and response to the limitations of traditional
disaggregated approaches. In such approaches, three traffic demand-forecasting methods, the full sample-demand
distribution model, the traffic integration model, the model organism protein expression database model,
are discussed. Undoubtedly, the development of big data also presents new challenges to travel-demand forecasting
methods regarding data acquisition, data processing, data analysis, and application of results. In particular,
identifying how to improve approaches to traffic-demand forecasting in the big data era in the Third World
will be a challenge to the researchers in the field. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Advancements in citizen sensing and geospatial big data have enabled new opportunities for government-citizen
interactions and have played important roles in developing smart(er) cities. In addition to city governments and
citizens actively using maps to communicate spatial planning issues, the increasing capabilities of citizens generating
spatial data either actively or passively allow city governments to collect local spatial knowledge with unprecedented
breadth at finer spatiotemporal resolutions. New methods for citizens collaborating with city governments are also
emerging to enhance citizen engagement and to spur social innovation. By synthesizing recent advancements in geoenabled
citizen participation, this paper proposed a new typology for classifying and characterizing concepts and
practices related to geospatial technology-mediated public participation in local governments (e.g. city and municipal
governments). Practical examples are used to illustrate how new dynamics between local governments and citizens
are formed, new methods of collecting local spatial knowledge are enabled, and new opportunities for improving the
openness and operational efficiency of local governments have emerged. The proposed conceptualization and examples
give rise to emerging needs of advancing geo-participation by developing geospatial methods and infrastructure
and by investigating the social and spatial implications of geo-participation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Existing jobs-housing balance studies have relied heavily if not solely on small data. Via a case study of Shanghai,
this study shows how cellular network data can be processed to derive useful information, job and housing
locations of commuters in particular, for those studies. Based on cellular network data, this article quantifies
and visualizes Shanghai's jobs-housing balance with a much larger sample (n = 6.3 million), finer spatial resolution
and greater geographic coverage than ever before. It identifies and geocodes the local commuters by
Base Transceiver Station (BTS), which has on average a service area of 0.16 km2. After detecting jobs and housing
by BTS, it aggregates them by subareas of particular interest (e.g., traffic analysis zones, inner city, suburbs and
exurbs) to local planners and decision-makers. It also visualizes the traffic flows associated with the actual
(Tact), theoreticalminimum(Tmin) and maximum(Tmax) commutes. It shows that Shanghai's commuting pattern
is far from the extremes (indicated by Tmax and Tmin traffic flows) and Shanghai's relative balance of jobs with
respect to housing is decent (3.2 km) despite its huge population (24 million) and land area sizes (6800 km2).
The cumulative distribution of the Tact and Tmin flows vary more significantly when the commuting distance is
less than 6 km. In theory, there is high concentration of both jobs and housing within a 6-kilometer radius across
different locales of the city. This potentially allows over 95% of all the local workers to find a job within 6 km of
his/her residence or vice versa. In reality, a much lower percentage (71%) of workers can enjoy such a benefit.
This can imply that there is qualitative mismatch between jobs and housing. </td>

during a day; thus, there are dynamic semantics of spaces in a city. Knowing the dynamic semantics of urban
spaces, which are implied in spatiotemporal patterns of human activities, can help urban planners and managers
understand how a city performs over time and space. The very large amount of multidimensional user-generated
data makes it possible to disclose the spatiotemporal patterns of human activities from multiple perspectives. In
this paper, using Beijing as a case study, we extract the dynamic semantics of urban spaces through the spatiotemporal
patterns of human activities discovered from crowdsourced positioning data. A high-order decomposition
method, tensor factorization, is used to explore the crowdsourced positioning data. The decomposition
results reveal five hourly patterns, four daily patterns and six spatial patterns of urban dynamics in
Beijing, showing that urban dynamics in Beijing vary noticeably over different hours, days and space. The
human activities implicated by hourly and daily patterns are inferred through empirical knowledge, and the
activity semantics of spatial patterns are further disclosed by using the interaction relations among three dimensions
stored in the core tensor. The k-means clustering method is executed to aggregate similar spatial units
into one group. Five clusters of regions with similar activity semantics are discovered, the function semantics of
clusters are clarified with point of interest (POI) data. </td>

spatial patterns of daily flow mobility cities from the perspective of population daily mobility distribution levels,
flow distribution layers network aggregation, spatial patterns and characteristics of the complex structure of the
flow network. Results show that “Tencent migration” big data clearly discovers the temporal-spatial pattern of
population mobility in China during the period of NDMAF. The net inflow of population showed a diamond
shaped with cross frame support in each period, the four nodes of the diamond contain Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Xi'an. Main mobility assembling centers are distributed in the urban agglomerations of Beijing-
Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta and Chengdu-Chongqing, and those centers have strong
coherence with those urban hierarchies. Most cities are in a state of “relative equilibrium” in the population
flow, and clear hierarchical structure and level distinction can be identified. Spatial patterns of population
mobility present obvious core-periphery structures. The Dali-Hegang line exhibits a significant network of spatial
differences in terms of boundary divisions. In this context, the spatial distribution of urban network could be
summarized as “dense in the East and sparse in the West”, and the core linkages of urban network could be
characterized as “parallel in the East and series in the West”. The whole network exhibits a typical “small world”
network characteristic, which shows that China's urban population flow network has high connectivity and
accessibility during the period of NDMAF. The network has a distinct “community” structure in the local area,
including 2 national communities, 2 regional communities and 3 local-level communities. </td>

of urban population density were explored with the population density index (PDI), spatial correlation
index (SCI) and ordinary least squares (OLS) models. The results suggest that the change of population density in
different regions is different, and the change on working days and off days is also different; no matter on working
days or off days, the urban population density distribution in different time slots shows the characteristics of
agglomeration; land use has great influence on distribution of urban population density in different time slots;
the purpose of residents' activities, the difference of spatial functions, and the interaction between them cause
the spatiotemporal evolution of urban population density. The conclusion shows that the Baidu heat map data

amount of coverage that a city received in the Internet news media (attribute data) and the distance decay effect
in Internet search of a city from other cities (relational data). We used the Baidu Media Index and Search Index of
city names in China to capture the amount of yearly city exposure in the Internet news media and how often
cities have been searched by Internet users in other cities, respectively. Our results show that the extent of
Internet news coverage of a city is highly related to that city's real-world characteristics including its administrative
status, economic development, tourist resources, and its distance to/from Beijing. Besides, the distance
decay coefficients in the Internet search of cities vary widely and the effects are mediated by the city's amount of
coverage in the Internet news media, job opportunities and transport functions. There is evidence to suggest that
the hierarchy of cities in virtual space has been heavily shaped by specific social, economic, and political factors. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Investigating the varying ridership patterns of rail transit ridership and their influencing factors at the station
level is essential for station planning, urban planning, and passenger flow management. Although many studies
have investigated the associations between rail transit ridership and built environment, few studies combined
spatial big data to characterize the built environment factors at a fine scale and linked those factors with the
varying patterns of rail transit ridership. In this study, we characterized the fine-scale built environment factors
in the central urban area of Guangzhou, China, by integrating multi-source geospatial big data including Tencent
user data, building footprint and stories, points of interest (POI) data and Google Earth high-resolution images.
Six direct ridership models (DRMs) based on the backward stepwise regression method were built to compare the
different effects between daily, temporal and directional ridership. The results indicated that number of station
entrances/exits and transfer dummy, were positively associated with rail transit ridership, while connecting bus
station sites and the parking lots were not significantly related to ridership. Population density and common
residences land were found to be dominating factors in promoting morning boarding &amp; evening alighting ridership,
which implied that these two factors should be focused on to encourage commuting-purpose rail transit usage.
However, the indistinct effect of urban villages on rail transit ridership suggested planners to pay more attentions
on urban regeneration at the pedestrian catchment areas (PCAs) with urban villages. High employment
density and a large FAR were suggested at the employment-oriented areas owing to their importance in promoting
rail transit ridership, especially the morning alighting &amp; evening boarding ridership. Moreover, educational
research land use significantly affected weekday ridership while sports land use positively influenced weekend
ridership, which suggested planners to pay more attention on the non-commuting trips. The different influencing
mechanisms of various types of rail transit ridership highlighted the need to consider land use balance planning
and trip demand optimization in highly urbanized metropolises in developing countries. </td>

their development level is a matter of great interest. Using geographic big data that cover the entire
country, this paper analyzes the urban development level (UDL) of newly added outlying patches within 275
cities at the prefecture level or above in China from 2005 to 2015. The results revealed the following. 1) Highvalue
cities are primarily located in the east, whereas low-value cities are primarily located in the west. The
Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration (BTHUA) is a major area with low UDLs, whereas the Yangtze River
Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA) and the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration (PRDUA) are major areas
with high UDLs. 2) The results of a multivariate regression demonstrate that GDP per capita (GDPPC), average
elevation (AE), the distance between the new outlying urban patches, the proportion of secondary industry in
GDP (PSI), the average land price in the city (ALP), the original urban land areas (DIS), and economic balance
(GDPSD) significantly affect the UDL values of these cities. Relatively higher GDPPC and ALP are associated with
a significant increase in the UDL, while more AE, DIS, GDPSD and PSI will decrease the UDL. The results of this
paper provide a reference to understand the conditions of outlying developmental zones in China over the past
10 years as well as to explore healthy and reasonable urban spatial expansion forms. </td>

bicycle) during 17:30 and 20:30 in June 2016. Based on the travel time calculations, we develop four travel
time indicators to measure the healthy food accessibility: the minimum, the maximum, the weighted
average, and the standard deviation. Results show that the four accessibility indicators generate different
estimations and the nearest service (minimum time) alone fails to reflect the multidimensional nature of
healthy food accessibility. The communities within Shenzhen present quite different typology with
respect to healthy food accessibility under different transport modes. Multilevel additive regression is
further applied to examine the associations between healthy food accessibility and nested socioeconomic
characteristics at two geographic levels (community and district). We discover that the associations are
divergent with transport modes and with geographic levels. More specifically, significant social equalities
in healthy food accessibility are identified via walking, public transit, and bicycle in Shenzhen. Based on
the associations, we finally map the food deserts and propose corresponding planning strategies. The
methods demonstrated in this study should offer deeper spatial insights into intra-urban foodscapes and
provide more nuanced understanding of food deserts in urban settings of developing countries. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper seeks to understand extreme public transit riders in Beijing using both traditional household
surveys and emerging new data sources such as Smart Card Data (SCD). We focus on four types of
extreme transit behaviors: public transit riders who (1) travel significantly earlier than average riders
(‘early birds’); (2) ride in unusual late hours (‘night owls’); (3) commute in excessively long distance
(‘tireless itinerants’); and (4) make significantly more trips per day (‘recurring itinerants’). SCD are used
to identify the spatiotemporal patterns of these four extreme transit behaviors. In addition, household
surveys are employed to supplement the socioeconomic background and tentatively profile extreme
travelers. While the research findings are useful to guide urban governance and planning in Beijing, our
methodology and procedures can be extended to understand travel patterns elsewhere. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The study of urban life resilience from the perspective of supply and demand and supported by spatial big data is
an innovative attempt to investigate traditional related research topics, ideas and methods. On the basis of
interpreting the connotation of resilience behind the main contradictions and urban transformation in China at
present and introducing the perspective of supply and demand to shape the analysis framework of urban life
resilience, this study takes Nanjing as a typical case to study the spatial characteristics of urban life resilience and
proposes pertinent adjustment strategies with support from spatial big data. Results show the following. (1)
Spatial differentiation among urban livelihood, activity and comprehensive life resilience is significant and
presents a ‘centre-periphery’ spatial structure with different gradients that show increasing and decreasing
trends. (2) Urban livelihood and activity resilience mainly show low-high spatial negative autocorrelation
characteristics. Residents in central urban areas are more likely than others to pursue activity resilience, due to
agglomeration, whereas residents in towns outside central urban areas are not greatly affected by urban life
resilience due to the low level of population agglomeration. (3) The agglomeration characteristics of coupling
coordination level are not significant as the distribution of low-level coupling coordination areas is mixed, with
only the coupling coordination level of peripheral towns being slightly high. The strategy of improving urban life
resilience should focus on priority, pertinence, cross-regional dynamic guidance, coordinated governance of
related urban problems and the impact of new science and technology and urban development concepts. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Urban planning and its relevant transportation deploying have a particularly profound influence on the sustainability
and livability of a city, and which also be crucial to the quality of life to urban residents at the same
time. It was also suggested that the conception of livability should be extended to embrace the concerns associated
with the sustainability. However, planning frameworks or assessment patterns that address the dynamics
of urban planning and demand for transportation deploying are relatively rare; there also few public policies in
related research fields have discussed the effects of the changes in various assessment indicators over time.
Furthermore, following the rising advancements in social communication and computer technologies in modern
society, the data collection, storage, and processing capabilities of people have improved substantially. And, the
emergence of big data or extendible open data facilitates analysis and prediction availability, and enabled people
to find immediate solutions to numerous dilemmas encountered. Therefore, based on the aforementioned intention,
treating the city as a dynamic process with the trying of introducing the big data or extendible open data
for facilitating urban sustainability and livability is undoubtedly worth to explore in further.
The present study intends to initially examine the application of big data in sustainable and livable transportation
strategies in Taipei City, Taiwan. Firstly, we investigate previous research on transportation sustainability
in various countries to generalize our preliminary list of transportation sustainability indices that satisfy
the principles of livable cities. And, key indices were then selected through the Fuzzy Delphi Method by administering
a questionnaire to six experts from industrial, governmental, and academic sectors respectively. The
research results were applied to develop decision-making strategies for responding to the environmental dynamics
of Taipei City's transportation infrastructure system by using the analytic network process combined with
a data-mining technique. Thus, big data pertaining to urban transportation were analyzed to predict the future
dynamic trends of the key indices and prioritize the sustainable transportation strategies for a livable city under
dynamic temporal and spatial changes. Ultimately, the policy implications of this study can not only offer a
solution for current needs related to urban planning but also serve as a more transparent decision-making or well
selection basis for developing sustainable and livable urban life in near future. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Substantial motor vehicle exhaust, a primary cause of air pollution, is emitted on short car trips of
three miles or less. Bicycles have been considered an optimum means of completing these short
trips because the bicycle is an environmentally friendly, economical, and convenient vehicle.
Accordingly, many countries have adopted public bicycle-sharing systems to reduce the use of
private vehicles for short trips in central downtown areas. In this paper, we propose a new framework,
based on taxi trajectory data, for locating bicycle-sharing stations most efficiently to
replace short automobile trips. The proposed framework is applied to Gangnam-gu, a district
within the city of Seoul, Korea. Results using two different location-allocation models are demonstrated.
As expected, when the p-median model was implemented, the selected stations were
more scattered over the whole district, whereas when the MCLP model was implemented, the
stations were more concentrated on central areas. Our approach is applicable to any city considering
a bicycle-sharing system and can contribute to the system’s efficiency in improving
environmental conditions in a central downtown area. </td>

human society. Two emerging challenges faced by rural communities today are cost
control and equity due to the increasing demand and limited operations resources available
and the need to deal with the inevitable tradeoffs among multiple objectives and
criteria. In this paper, we develop a new methodology for rural transportation management
which takes into consideration of both the equity and cost factors under multiple
objectives. We conceptualize and define equity in rural transportation management
with the development of new performance measures and an analytical model for decision
making with multiple desirable and undesirable objectives. We also develop a
heuristic procedure based on data envelopment analysis for characterizing and analyzing
the route design choices on the frontier between costs and multi-objective measures
of equity. A GIS-based decision support system is constructed to process the extensive
data required in our analysis. The new methodology has been successfully implemented
by Quinte Access, a not-for-profit organization in a rural community in Ontario, to help
redesign bus routes with significant quantitative benefits observed in multiple performance
dimensions. It is also expected that the new knowledge, insights, and decision
support tools developed through this study for transportation planning, big data management,
and transportation service operations can be transferred to other rural communities
in order to deliver more sustainable transportation services in rural regions

carry out their activities in a city, they leave behind a digital fingerprint that can be used to
analyze the population’s daily mobility patterns and determine the exact times of travel between
points of origin and destination at different times of the day. These data present high spatial and
temporal resolution, and enable accurate and dynamic analysis of accessibility. The objective of
this study was to conduct a dynamic analysis of urban accessibility considering its two main
components: travel times and the attractiveness of destinations. To this end, we calculated travel
times between transport zones using the Google Maps API and constructed origin and destination
(OD) travel matrices from mobile phone records. Several scenarios were generated to analyze
dynamic accessibility and the separate influence of its two components. We also conducted a
cluster analysis to characterize transport zones according to their accessibility in each of the
scenarios and times of day considered. Our results indicate that these new sources of geolocated
data show considerable potential for use in time-sensitive accessibility studies, since they yield
more accurate and realistic information than static or partially dynamic analyses. Such information
could help politicians take better decisions concerning transport and land use. </td>

infrastructure. Comprehensive analysis of port competitiveness is of great significance for effectively
guiding the flow of such resources. Conventional models mainly consider statistical
indices for port operation, while neglecting the real operational status of these ports and their
position in the changing global maritime transport network. To fill this gap in existing research,
we designed a comprehensive evaluation CCPE model measuring port competitiveness by 18
factors related to conditions, capacity, potential, and efficiency using big data related to the
geographical environment, cargo vessels trajectories, port infrastructure, and regional socioeconomics.
This model was then used to evaluate the competitiveness of 99 ports in 51 countries
along the Maritime Silk Road, with several important results. First, a port’s status in the global
maritime transport network was the most influential of all competitiveness indices. Second,
competitive ports were mainly concentrated in the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the
Hormuz Strait, with Singapore, Marsaxlokk, and Algeciras ranking as the top three. The least
competitive ports were mainly concentrated in East Africa, with Rangoon, Berbera, Lamu,
Songkhla, Mtwara, and Sittwe ranking lowest. Third, port competitiveness was clearly polarized
in that the most competitive ports stood far above all others due to significant gaps in their
network status index. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Although cycling is an easy and popular form of physical activity and urban travel, barriers exist.
In particular, cycling is more likely and more severely to be affected by inclement weather than
the motorized modes as the cyclists are entirely exposed to outdoor environment. Understanding
the weather-cycling relationship is of great importance to academics and practitioners for cycling
activity analysis and promotion. This study contributes to an in-depth understanding of how the
changes in weather conditions affect cycling on an off-road trail and an on-road (bridge) bike
lane at both daily and hourly scales across four seasons. The paper compares the weather-cycling
relationship based on day of week and time of day combinations. The autocorrelation effect of
cycling itself and the lagging effect of weather elements are also examined. The findings indicate
that cycling is significantly self-dependent especially at the finer temporal scales. Weather have a
very different influence on bicycle usage of off-road trails versus on-road bike lanes. When it rains
its negative impact not only continues but also significantly affects the cycling within previous
one hour. At the daily level, weekend cycling on the trail is less likely to be affected by weather as
compared to cycling on the bike lane, whilst inverse is true for weekday cycling. Cycling is most
likely to be affected by weather conditions in spring and least likely to be affected in winter.
Cycling pattern which is more unrelated to weather at the aggregated level tends to be more
flexibly adjusted according to the real-time weather conditions at the disaggregated level.
Cyclists on weekends especially during the weekend peak hours (11 AM–4 PM) tend to have more
flexibility to adjust their cycling schedule before or after the adverse weather conditions than on
weekdays. In addition, cyclists with utilitarian purposes are more likely to shift from cycling to
other modes (e.g., transit) due to real-time bad weather conditions in weekdays than in weekends,
especially during weekday peak hours (7–9 AM and 4–6 PM). The results provide weather
officials, transport agencies and research institutions with valuable information for cycling activity
analysis and promotion by considering the effects of weather events especially rainfall. </td>

is often presented as a singular, outdated, and rationalist theory.
After critically reviewing the history of CPT, we assess the microfoundations
of Christaller’s CPT – the threshold and range of goods – for
various central functions in Louisville, Kentucky. The microfoundations
are estimated through data from social media platforms
Foursquare and Twitter. These sources alleviate many of the operationalization
issues that traditionally hamper empirical use of CPT.
The empirical application of CPT reveals that: (i) central functions
have typical ranges and thresholds relating central places to population
spread; (ii) central functions cluster based on an approximate
hierarchical structure. The findings indicate the ongoing importance
of CPT in shaping urban-economic geographies. </td>

excess commuting (EC) framework. To show the feasibility of the proposed measurement method, we chose New
York City (NYC) as the study area and employed open taxi data. By calculating the efficiency value of the OD level,
we discovered that the average distance of highly efficient taxi trips is much longer than that of inefficient
trips. Then, the OD-level efficiency value is applied to the EC framework by replacing the conventional cost unit

taxi trips within Manhattan and to the two airports (LGA and JFK) should be particularly considered if citywide

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Accessibility by high-speed rail (HSR) depends not only on station-to-station travel time, but also on access and
egress times, which can be determining factors in total journey travel time. However, studies focusing on accessibility
analyses of access/egress times to/from stations are less extended in the literature and centre mainly
on the influence of access times to stations on HSR accessibility levels on a regional scale. This paper's aim is to
evaluate the importance of access and egress times to/from HSR stations in an urban context. We carry out a
spatiotemporal accessibility analysis that considers the temporal variations of both taxi and public transport
travel times. General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files for public transport and TomTom Speed Profiles
data for cars are used to measure access/egress times. These kinds of data allow for the calculation of travel times
from/to HSR stations through network analysis GIS tools at different times of the day, and thus a spatiotemporal
accessibility measure can be obtained. This accessibility measure is complemented by a mass factors representing
the activity ‘hotspots’ in the visited city throughout the workday, which is derived from Twitter data,
while population is considered for city of residence. This method was applied to the two largest metropolitan
areas in Spain: Madrid and Barcelona, where the influence of access/egress times acquires a higher relevance for
rail-based trips. The results obtained show that access and egress times vary significantly during the day, depending
on the levels of traffic congestion and the frequency of public transport services, which are always more
favourable for taxis. In addition, weighted average access and egress times at the home end are higher than those
at the activity end since population tends to show more dispersed spatial patterns than activities. Another interesting
finding is that the first and last mile of the HSR trip usually account for a high percentage increase in
travel time (about 35% for taxis and 55% for public transport, respectively). These results have important policy
implications. The paper suggests that HSR accessibility can be improved also by improving local transport
services, scheduling coordination and land use policies. </td>

spatial patterns of human movements in urban areas including cycling. We explore data obtained from the Tel
Aviv bike-sharing system and corresponding GTFS data, to understand the spatial patterns of cycling in the city
and its relation to bus travel. Using a combination of transportation and geostatistical models including spatially
adjusted regression, and all-or-nothing traffic assignment, we show that cycling movements are not well balanced
and different behaviors are associated with the length of trips. Shorter trips are more concentrated in the
city center and seem to complement bus travel. Longer trips are more focused on links with dedicated bicycle
lanes and do not show strong correlations with bus travel, possibly indicating a weak substitution effect. The
implications of data-driven studies for transport policy and spatial inquiries of urban mobility are further discussed. </td>

systems </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper considers the implications of so-called ‘big data’ for the analysis, modelling and planning of transport
systems. The primary conceptual focus is on the needs of the practical context of medium-term planning and
decision-making, from which perspective the paper seeks to achieve three goals: (i) to try to identify what is truly
‘special’ about big data; (ii) to provoke debate on the future relationship between transport planning and big
data; and (iii) to try to identify promising themes for research and application. Differences in the information
that can be derived from the data compared to more traditional surveys are discussed, and the respects in which
they may impact on the role of models in supporting transport planning and decision-making are identified. It is
argued that, over time, changes to the nature of data may lead to significant differences in both modelling
approaches and in the expectations placed upon them. Furthermore, it is suggested that the potential widespread
availability of data to commercial actors and travellers will affect the performance of the transport systems
themselves, which might be expected to have knock-on effects for planning functions. We conclude by proposing
a series of research challenges that we believe need to be addressed and warn against adaptations based on
minimising change from the status quo. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Yongping Zhang, Diao Lin, Xiaoyue Cathy Liu </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Bike trajectories generated by the dockless bike-sharing service provides a great opportunity to explore users'
travel behavior within the shared mobility transportation ecosystem. This paper proposes a new concept, namely
biking islands, defined as geographical areas of interest with a high concentration of bike usage. Leveraging
high-resolution trajectory data, biking islands are identified via percolation theory because of its suitability in
describing the formation of clusters and critical road segments that have significant influence on biking behavior
in an urban context. We showcase our methodology using the bike trajectory dataset provided by a marketleading
company and use Shanghai, China as the study area. Results reveal a hierarchical structure of biking
islands. With the increase of threshold, the biking islands start to shrink and split into various smaller ones.
Larger biking islands are usually located in the central urban area of Shanghai and the Huangpu River acts as a
natural barrier that impedes biking continuity across the region. Besides, the formation of biking islands is highly
influenced by the surrounding land uses. The proposed concept and methods are not only helpful to understand
travel behavior of cyclists and urban structures used for cycling, but also has the potential to support relevant
urban and transportation planning, such as identifying designated non-motorized areas for cycling and biking
facilities and pinpointing critical road segments that can improve the cycling efficiency of the entire network.
Biking islands could be designed as designated areas for cycling where sufficient bike facilities are provided,
and/or motorized transport modes are restricted or even prohibited, so as to ensure the convenience and safety
of cyclists and support the development of bike-friendly cities. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper aims to estimate the causal effect of accidents on traffic congestion and vice versa. In order to identify
both effects of this two-way relationship, I use dynamic panel data techniques and open access ‘big data’ of
highway traffic and accidents in England for the period 2012–2014. The research design is based on the dailyand-hourly specific mean reversion pattern of highway traffic, which can be used to define a recurrent congestion
benchmark. Using this benchmark, I am able to identify the causal effect of accidents on non-recurrent
traffic congestion. A positive relationship between traffic congestion and road accidents would yield multiplicative
benefits for policies that aim at reducing either of these issues. Additionally, I explore the duration of
the effect of an accident on congestion, the ‘rubbernecking’ effect, as well as heterogeneous effects in the most
congested highway segments. Then, I test the use of methods which employ the bulk of information in big data
and other methods using a very reduced sample. In my application, both approaches produce similar results.
Finally, I find a non-linear negative effect of traffic congestion on the probability of an accident. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Commuting patterns where most if not all 'trips are optimised relative to a given distribution of jobs and housing
can result in personal and socio-economic benefits. Excess commuting indicators provide useful information for
academics and policy analysts to evaluate how the actual commuting pattern deviates from an optimal pattern
where commuting costs are minimised. While actual commuting patterns vary from day-to-day, academic researchers
have yet to quantify the temporal variation in these indicators over short time periods. This may be due
to the lack of available longitudinal data as input for excess commuting indicators. This study shows that new,
open and/or big data (NOBD) (e.g. smartcard data) can be exploited to serve as the input for such analysis. In
this regard, our study uses half a year's worth of smartcard data from Brisbane, Australia to first derive/aggregate
origins and destinations by small areas of the probable commuting trips by transit on all 122 weekdays
over the study period. The study quantifies the day-to-day variation in excess commuting indicators for these
trips and finds that excess commuting indicators vary considerably from one day to the next. Nevertheless, daily
variations occur within a relatively consistent range which can be planned for. Our research suggests that more
conscious and systematic utilisation of NOBD could change how commuting flows in cities are quantified,
monitored and planned. In addition, with NOBD, we can more efficiently detect daily outliers in commuting
patterns. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Utilization of movement data from mobile sports tracking applications is affected by its inherent biases and sensitivity,
which need to be understood when developing value-added services for, e.g., application users and city
planners. We have developed a method for generating a privacy-preserving heat map with user diversity
(ppDIV), in which the density of trajectories, as well as the diversity of users, is taken into account, thus
preventing the bias effects caused by participation inequality. The method is applied to public cycling workouts
and compared with privacy-preserving kernel density estimation (ppKDE) focusing only on the density of the recorded
trajectories and privacy-preserving user count calculation (ppUCC),which is similar to the quadrat-count
of individual application users. An awareness of privacy was introduced to all methods as a data pre-processing
step following the principle of k-Anonymity. Calibration results for our heat maps using bicycle counting data
gathered by the city of Helsinki are good (R2 N 0.7) and raise high expectations for utilizing heat maps in a city
planning context. This is further supported by the diurnal distribution of the workouts indicating that, in addition
to sports-oriented cyclists, many utilitarian cyclists are tracking their commutes. However, sports tracking data
can only enrich official in-situ counts with its high spatio-temporal resolution and coverage, not replace them. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The recent proliferation of big data sources has given rise to a data deluge. Network theory has become
the standard methodology to frame, develop and analyze such massive datasets. In line with the critique of
Schwanen (2016), we argue in this paper that initiatives confronting network-based insights with (qualitative)
location- and domain-specific insights are necessary in understanding, discussing and advancing the role network
analysis can play in geography. By iterating a community detection algorithm to achieve different levels of
communities and quantifying the borders between them through damping values (as proposed in Grauwin et al.,
2017), we show how to derive the hierarchical structure within the logistics buyer-supplier network in Belgium.
This allows for a richer geography, which has been missing in current big data studies. </td>

transit-oriented development and sustainable urban growth. Geographically weighted regression (GWR)
models have previously been employed to reveal the spatial differences in such relationships at the station level.
However, few studies characterized the built environment at a fine scale and associated them with rail transit
usage. Moreover, none of the existing studies attempted to categorize the stations for policy-making considering
varying impacts of the built environment. In this study, taking Guangzhou as an example, we integrated multisource
spatial big data, such as high spatial resolution remote sensing images, points of interest (POIs), social
media and building footprint data to precisely quantify the characteristics of the built environment. This was
combined with a GWR model to understand how the impacts of the fine-scale built environment factors on the
rail transit ridership vary across the study region. The k-means clustering method was employed to identify
distinct station groups based on the coefficients of the GWR model at the local stations. Policy zoning was
proposed based on the results and differentiated planning guidance was suggested for different zones. These
recommendations are expected to help increase rail transit usage, inform rail transit planning (to relieve the
traffic burden on currently crowed lines), and re-allocate industrial and living facilities to reduce the commute
for the residents. The policy and planning implications are crucial for the coordinated development of the rail
transit system and land use. </td>

and jobs–housing balance is examined with job types, location, and housing prices using the cellphone data in
Shenzhen, China. Jobs–housing balance is found to be more important in self-containment of employment for
secondary-sector workers compared with that for tertiary-sector workers. Secondary-sector workers tend to
reside near their workplaces because of relatively balanced jobs and housing, whereas tertiary-sector workers
tend to reside farther away from their workplaces to save housing cost. The study enhances our understanding of

have been made to reveal the spatial variations of multi-modal public ridership (such as buses, metro systems,
and taxis) and the underlying controlling factors. This study explores multi-modal public ridership and compares
the similarities and differences of the associated factors. Daily bus, metro, and taxi ridership patterns are first
extracted from multiple sources of big transportation data, including vehicle (bus and taxi) GPS trajectories and
smart card data. Multivariate regression analysis and geographically weighted regression analysis are used to
reveal the associations between these data and demographic, land use, and transportation factors. An empirical
study in Shenzhen, China, suggests that employment, mixed land use, and road density have significant effects
on the ridership of each mode; however, some effects vary from negative to positive across the city. The results
also indicate that road density, income, and metro accessibility do not have significant effects on metro, transit
or bus ridership. These findings suggest that the effects of the associated factors vary depending on the mode of
travel being considered and that the city should carefully consider which factors to emphasize in formulating
future transport policy </td>

visualization tool in this regard, but most current methods are based on scalar objects that lack directionality
and rate of change – key attributes of travel. The few studies that do consider field-based time geography
have largely looked at vector fields for individuals, not populations. A population-based vector field
is proposed for visualizing time-geographic demand momentum. The field is estimated using a vector
kernel density generated from observed trajectories of a sample population. By representing transport
systems as vector fields that share the same time–space domain, demand can be projected onto the systems
to visualize relationships between them. This visualization tool offers a powerful approach to visually
correlate changes in the systems with changes in demand, as demonstrated in a case study of the
Greater Toronto Area using data from the 2006 and 2011 Transportation Tomorrow Surveys. As a result,
it is now possible to measure in real time the effects of disasters on the economic welfare of a population,
or quantify the effects of operational strategies and designs on the behavioural activity patterns of the

   <td style="text-align:left;"> As sources of “Big Data” continue to grow, transportation planners and researchers seek
to utilize these new resources. Given the current dependency on traditional transportation
data sources and conventional tools (e.g., spreadsheets and propriety models), how
can these new resources be used? This research examines a “blended data” approach,
using a web-based, open source platform to assist transit agencies to forecast bus ridership.
The platform is capable of incorporating new Big Data sources and traditional data
sources, using modern processing techniques and tools, particularly Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs). This research demonstrates the use of APIs in a transit demand
methodology that yields a robust model for bus ridership. The approach uses the Census
Transportation Planning Products data, modified with American Community Survey data,
to generate origin–destination tables for bus trips in a designated market area. Microsimulation
models us a transit scheduling specification (General Transit Feed Specification) and
an open source routing engine (OpenTripPlanner). Local farebox data validates the microsimulation
models. Analyses of model output and farebox data for the Atlantic City transit
market area, and a scenario analysis of service reduction in the Princeton/Trenton transit
market area, illustrate the use a “blended approach” for bus ridership forecasting. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Spatial interaction is an important phenomenon that reflects the human–land relationship
and has long been a core topic in multiple fields, such as urban planning, transportation
planning, commodity trade, and epidemic prevention. However, as an underlying cause
of spatial interaction, function complementarity has been ignored by existing research for
a long time. At the same time, the increase in Big Data of travel behavior provides an
opportunity to model spatial interactions in detail. In this paper, we proposed three types of
land-use function complementarity indices according to the spatiotemporal characteristics
of human mobility. These complementarity indices are introduced to spatial interaction to
improve the gravity model. We also examined the effects of land function complementarity
on intra-urban spatial interaction using smart card records of metro system for different
time periods and directions. The results showed that all models could be improved by
introducing the land-use function complementarity indices, but the models with a single
travel pattern and clear direction were explained more by the complementary indices. The
indices we propose in this paper could be used for predicting spatial flow and trip distribution,
and also could be considered as factors in researches about transportation and landuse
planning. </td>

activity type classification models were built using household travel survey and a rich set

to the transit smart card dataset to extract the embedded activity information. The proposed
approach enables to spatially and temporally quantify, visualize, and examine urban activity

data and network information, which limits the applicability of the simulator to real world problems.
For example, accurate information regarding travel time, link traffic volume and trip distribution is essential
for sensitivity analysis using an activity-based travel simulator. Survey data, which relies on respondents’
memories, is typically inaccurate. The recent development of big data engineering has enabled us
to use passively collected big data such as from smartcards and navigation devices; their travel time and
spatial information is highly accurate. Activity-based travel simulation based on the household travel
survey (HTS) can therefore identify inaccuracies in simulated travels by comparing smartcard and navigation
device data. This paper aims to examine the accuracy of journeys simulated by an activity-based
travel simulator, FEATHERS Seoul (FS), against smartcard and car navigation device data collected in
Seoul. The analysis found that the activity-based simulator performs well and reproduces individual travel
decisions, as reflected by the overall trip frequency and distance, but it partly fails to correctly reproduce
geographical distributions in flexible, non-work trip destinations. The results imply that an activity-based
travel simulator needs to improve its incorporation of geographical characteristics using big data
engineering to enhance the simulated travel accuracy. </td>

driving trajectory, and whether these behaviors vary when the geospatial context of parking changes. An ontology-
based approach is used to frame the key behaviors of the naturalistic driving, and big data techniques are
applied to extract parking-specific behaviors from driving trajectories. Results show that individuals showed
relatively consistent parking behaviors under the same geospatial context and the standard deviation of the
deceleration threshold has a larger discrepancy between couples parking at different residences than within
couples where parking occurs at the same place. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> To examine the variability of travel behaviour over time, transportation researchers need to collect longitudinal
data. The first studies around day-to-day variability of travel behaviour were based on surveys. Those studies
have shown that there is considerable variation in individual travel behaviour. They have also discussed the
implications of this variability in terms of modelling, policy evaluation or marketing. Recently, the multiplication
of big data has led to an explosion in the number of studies about travel behaviour. This is because
those new data sources collect lots of data, about lots of people over long periods. In the field of public transit,
smart card data is one of those big data sources. They have been used by various authors to conduct longitudinal
analyses of transit usage behaviour. However, researchers working with smart card data mostly rely on clustering
techniques to measure variability, and they often use conceptual framework different from those of
transportation researchers familiar with traditional data sources. In particular, there is no study based on smart
card data that explicitly measure day-to-day intrapersonal variability of transit usage. Therefore, the purpose of
this investigation is to address this gap. To do this, a clustering method and a similarity metric are combined to
explore simultaneously interpersonal and intrapersonal variability of transit usage. The application is done with
a rich dataset covering a 6 months period (181 days) and it contributes to the growing literature on smart card
data. Results of this research confirm previous works based on survey data and show that there is no one size fits
all approach to the problem of day-to-day variability of transit usage. They also prove that combining clustering
algorithm with day-to-day intrapersonal similarity metric is a valuable tool to mine smart card data. The findings
of this study can help in identifying new passenger segmentation and in tailoring information and services. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The demand for public transport and commuter behaviour are evidently affected by a series of D-factors relating
to the built environment, including density, diversity, design, destination and/or demography. The effect of fare
policies, however, in conjunction with built and non-built environment features has not been assessed. Given the
2017 fare policy change introduced in South East Queensland, Australia, this study examines how the policy
reform (changes in fares, its structure and incentives) affects public transport ridership. Drawing on two like-forlike
periods of transport smart card data before and after the policy reform, we compare the number of card
users, journeys, and travel costs under the two fare systems. Through a set of statistical analysis and spatial lag
regression, we examine the impact of the fare policy change on ridership, controlled by variations of built and
non-built environment features, including population density, land use diversity, demographic features of
commuters, distance to the central business district (CBD) and destination accessibility. Our findings show that
public transit ridership can be boosted by reducing the fare cost per journey which can then result in overall
revenue gain. However, such attraction by fare reduction varies substantially by user groups. Furthermore, the
influences of population density, destination accessibility, distance to CBD and demographic features of commuters
on ridership are significant (p &lt; 0.01); while the influences of land use diversity and fare change tend to
be insignificant compared to the other D-factors. We argue that in order to increase public transport usage policy
makers need to consider fare policy reform in conjunction with built environment and demographic factors in
order to increase service availability and ensure that services are accessible and affordable to the general public.
This study also offers a generic framework that employs big data analytics to assess public policy intervention in
the Australian context. </td>

Retaining customers and trying to attract new customers are crucial for liner companies’ survival. Thus, it
is vital for liner companies to deliver superior customer value with limited resources. This study aims to introduce
7 innovative solutions as design requirements (DRs) and examine to what extent these 7 solutions
facilitate to enhance 5 proposed customer values (CVs) in liner shipping. CVs and DRs are identified based on
literature analysis and then validated by interviewing academic and industry professionals. A case study of K

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The state-of-practice in planning, designing, and conducting freight surveys leave much to be desired, even in the
era of big data analytics. This paper addresses this issue by providing a comprehensive, yet, inexpensive integrated
data collection framework for conducting establishment-based freight survey (EBFS). The paper demonstrates
the application of the proposed framework by implementing it in eight cities across two geographically
dissimilar states of India. This is the first freight survey of its kind in terms of scale and scope in
developing countries, where there is no established practice in freight data collection. Guidelines are suggested
for overcoming challenges in EBFS such as: (a) efficient allocation of survey resources within budgetary constraints;
(b) effective survey instrument design for reducing the respondent burden; (c) determination of sample
size requirements and the expected number of sampling units to be contacted (d) development of sampling
strategies using sampling frames with limited auxiliary information; and (e) data collection strategies to improve
response rates. The heuristics for allocation of survey resources are mathematically formulated and predicted
using the web-based survey responses obtained from planners of past surveys. Trade-off scenarios between
different components of survey resources (money, time, and manpower) are presented to enable the planners to
arrive at a suitable EBFS design for meeting research requirements within resource constraints. Analysis of
results suggest that the response rates for EBFS are largely linked to the physical characteristics of commodities
and city demography. The discussions provided on resource allocation, survey instrument design, sampling
design, pilot surveys, interviewer training, response rate improvement strategies, and data processing are expected
to guide for best practices in future surveys. In sum, the literature synthesis, case-study illustrations, and
the proposed framework for EBFS design are expected to strengthen the state-of-practice of EBFS by making the
rigorous random sample surveys less expensive, more systematic, and in turn, replacing the need to opt for
convenience samples. </td>

information to help understand society and execute policies more efficiently – what we refer to as the data driven transition. We conduct a literature review to
identify the state of the art within international research and compare this with results from interviews and with a survey sent to representatives from the Norwegian
consultation business. We find that there is a considerable gap between international researchers and the consulting business within the entire process of collection,
management and analysis of traffic data, and that this gap is increasing with the emergence of the data driven transition. Finally, we argue that the results are

observed journey-to-work trips using travel survey data. This study examines the relationship
between the jobs–housing balance and the self-containment of employment through the use of
mobile phone location data in Shenzhen, a megacity in southern China. Individual-level journey-to work
trips are explored based on mobile phone location big data. Self-containment of
employment in the suburban districts is higher than that in the central districts. The effect of
the jobs–housing balance on self-containment of employment is examined at a 2 km grid level.
Jobs–housing balance policies positively affect the self-containment of employment in the
suburban districts, but its effect is limited in the central districts. Two extreme commuting
spectrum measures are used to analyze self-containment of employment in different journey-to-
work scenarios with the same jobs–housing distribution. Workers are disaggregated into
secondary and tertiary sector workers according to job types. The self-containment of
employment is found to be mainly affected by the local jobs–housing balance for secondarysector
workers and the regional city level job distribution for tertiary-sector workers. The
extreme scenarios of commuting behavior using the commuting spectrum method can provide
benchmarks that can help to understand the observed self-containment of employment better. </td>

air quality index prediction:
A case study of routes

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Urban big data include various types of datasets, such as air quality data, meteorological data, and
weather forecast data. Air quality index is broadly used in many countries as an indicator to
measure the air pollution status. This indicator has a great impact on outdoor activities of urban
residents, such as long-distance cycling, running, jogging, and walking. However, for routes planning
for outdoor activities, there is still a lack of comprehensive consideration of air quality. In this paper,
an air quality index prediction model (namely airQP-DNN) and its application are proposed to
address the issue. This paper primarily consists of two components. The first component is to
predict the future air quality index based on a deep neural network, using historical air quality
datasets, current meteorological datasets, and weather forecasting datasets. The second component
refers to a case study of outdoor activities routes planning in Beijing, which can help plan the
routes for outdoor activities based on the airQP-DNN model, and allow users to enter the origin
and destination of the route for the optimized path with the minimum accumulated air quality
index. The air quality monitoring datasets of Beijing and surrounding cities from April 2014 to April 2015 (over 758,000 records) are used to verify the proposed airQP-DNN model. The experimental
results explicitly demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms other commonly used
methods in terms of prediction accuracy, including autoregressive integrated moving average
model, gradient boosted decision tree, and long short-term memory. Based on the airQP-DNN
model, the case study of outdoor activities routes planning is implemented. When the origin and
destination are specified, the optimized paths with the minimum accumulated air quality index
would be provided, instead of the standard static Dijkstra shortest path. In addition, a Web-GISbased
prototype has also been successfully developed to support the implementation of our proposed
model in this research. The success of our study not only demonstrates the value of the
proposed airQP-DNN model, but also shows the potential of our model in other possible extended
applications. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Although people may recognize urban vibrancy when they see or sense it, developing direct and
comprehensive measures of urban vibrancy remains a challenge. In the context of intense global
competition, there is an increased realization that urban vibrancy is vital to the social and economic
sustainability of cities. Such vibrancy may be significantly shaped by the urban built environment,
yet we know little about the close connections between vibrancy and urban built
environments. Empowered by newly available sources of spatial big data, which provide enormous
amounts of information on both human dynamics and the built environment, this paper
proposes a framework for evaluating and characterizing urban vibrancy. Thus far, vibrancy measures
have mostly used single-source data that hardly reflect the multifaceted manifestations of
urban vibrancy. Therefore, we propose a more comprehensive measure of urban vibrancy,
extracted as the common latent factor from multiple surface attributes. Using the proposed
framework, we evaluated and mapped the spatial dynamics of vibrancy in Shanghai, a typical
large city in post-reform China, and investigated the associations between vibrancy and various
urban built environment indicators. The evidence shows that the horizontal built-up density,
rather than vertical height, is the leading generator of vibrancy in Shanghai, followed by the density and mixture of urban functions, accessibility, and walkability. In this vein, we contribute to
current debates and future planning practices regarding vibrant spaces in large cities. This proposed
evaluation framework, equipped with spatial big data, can benefit future urban studies. </td>

used to analyse the street network’s configuration for different radiuses. Multiple linear regression
models were fitted to explore the influence of these measures on cycling activity at the
street segment level after controlling other variables such as land use, household density, socioeconomic
status, and cycling infrastructure. The variation of such influence for different time
periods (weekday vs. weekend) and trip purposes (commuting vs. sports) was also analysed. The
results show a positive significant association between normalised angular choice (NACH) and
cycling activity. Although the final regression model explained 5.5% of the log-likelihood of the
intercept model, it represents an important improvement compared with the base (control-only)
model (3.8%). The incidence rate ratio of NACH’s Z scores was 1.63, implying that for an increase
of one standard deviation of NACH, there is an expected increment of about 63% in the total
cyclist counts while keeping all other variables the same. These results are of interest for
researchers, practitioners, and urban planners, since the inclusion of Space Syntax measures
derived from available public data can improve movement behaviour modelling and cycling
infrastructure planning and design. </td>

historical inventory of major development projects and crowdsourced citizen complaints
data (311 calls) in Vancouver, Canada from 2011 to 2016. Mixed effects models were developed
with an interaction between construction activities and after-hours report. Results show that
neighborhood noise complaints were significantly associated with major constructions
(IRR¼1.062, 95% CI¼1.024–1.097). A significant interaction effect was also found between
construction activities and after-hours reporting (IRR¼1.050 CI¼1.012–1.087). To our knowledge,
this is one of the first studies to empirically show the adverse effects of urban development
on noise annoyance. The results imply that existing noise bylaws may not be effective in restricting
construction activities at night and during sleeping hours, which may cause adverse
health effects. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> While there has been no shortage of discussion of urban big data, smart cities, and cities as
complex systems, there has been less discussion of the implications of big data as a source of
individual data for planning and social science research. This study takes advantage of increasingly
available land parcel and business establishment data to analyze how the measurement of proximity
to urban services or amenities performed in many fields can be impacted by using these
data—which can be considered “individual” when compared to aggregated origins or destinations.
We use business establishment data across five distinctive US cities: Long Beach, Irvine, and
Moreno Valley in California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and the New York borough of Staten Island.
In these case studies, we show how aggregation error, a previously recognized concern in using
census-type data, can be minimized through careful choice of distance measures. Informed by
these regions, we provide recommendations for researchers evaluating the potential risks of a
measurement strategy that differs from the “gold standard” of network distance from individually
measured, point-based origins and destinations. We find limited support for previous hypotheses
regarding measurement error based on the abundance or clustering of urban services or amenities,
though further research is merited. Importantly, these new data sources reveal vast differences
across cities, underscoring how accurate proximity measurement necessitates a critical
understanding of the nuances of the urban landscape under investigation as measures appear
heavily influenced by a city’s street layouts and historical development trajectories. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Traffic flows have always been a major element affecting the nature of urban streets. Traffic flows
influence the location of businesses, residences, and the development of real estate, land values,
and built-density. In this study, we suggest that revealing the relations between the static street
network and dynamic traffic flows may provide meaningful and useful insights that could be
applied in planning processes. Thus, the objective of this work is to unveil the inter-relations
between the dynamics of traffic flows and urban street networks in different areas of a city and
between cities. We use network percolation analysis (i.e., removal of links with a speed value
lower than a pre-defined threshold) to develop an innovative method to identify functional
spatio-temporal street clusters that represent fluent traffic flow. We employed our method on
two data sets of London and Tel Aviv centers and analyzed the dynamics of these clusters, based
on their size (in terms of street length) and their spatial stability over time. Our findings revealed
both the differences between the two cities as well as differences and similarities between
different areas within each city. Thus, our method can be used to develop new, real-time,
decision-making tools for urban and transportation planners. Today, new technologies provide
big data on urban traffic flow, which can be used in developing new, adaptive tools for planning.
However, urban and transportation planning are currently being challenged by real-time navigation apps that aim to find the fastest routes for their users. To be able to intervene and
affect urban life quality, planners should adopt new tools that are based on real-time, short-term
approaches. These will bridge the gap between static long-term urban planning and the flexible
and dynamic urban rhythm, and will enable planners to keep their role in the formation of
better cities. </td>

segregation of rural migrants, using residents living in the migrant enclaves of urban villages as a
proxy. Furthermore, this study identifies factors that affect the variations of workplace segregation.
The study shows that rural migrants who work in manufacturing industries and live in
suburban areas suffer from higher workplace segregation from other social groups compared
with those who work in service jobs and reside in the central-city areas, indicating that migrant
enclaves in central-city areas play a significant role in housing rural migrants. It provides them with
considerable access to service jobs and, thus, alleviates workplace segregation. Our results show
that the use of big data can effectively capture the dynamics of population composition in activity

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Problem, research strategy, and findings: Of the three primary components of housing affordability
measures—rent, transportation, and utilities—utility costs are the least understood yet are the one area
where the cost burden can be reduced without household relocation. Existing data sources to estimate
energy costs are limited to surveys with small samples and low spatial and temporal resolution, such as
the American Housing Survey and the Residential Energy Consumption Survey. In this study, we present
a new method for small-area estimates of household energy cost burdens (ECBs) that leverages actual
building energy use data for approximately 13,000 multifamily properties across five U.S. cities and links
energy costs to savings opportunities by analyzing 3,000 energy audit reports. We examine differentials in
cost burdens across household demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and analyze spatial,
regional, and building-level variations in energy use and expenditures. Our results show the average lowincome
household has an ECB of 7%, whereas higher income households have an average burden of 2%.
Notably, even within defined income bands, minority households experience higher ECBs than non-
Hispanic White households. For lower income households, low-cost energy improvements could reduce
energy costs by as much as $1,500 per year.
Takeaway for practice: In this study we attempt to shift the focus of energy efficiency investments to
their impact on household cost burdens and overall housing affordability. Our analysis explores new and
unique data generated from measurement-driven urban energy policies and shows low-income households
disproportionately bear the burden of poor-quality and energy-inefficient housing. Cities can use
these new data resources and methods to develop equity-based energy policies that treat energy efficiency
and climate mitigation as issues of environmental justice and that apply data-driven, targeted policies
to improve quality of life for the most vulnerable urban residents. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article argues for the importance of social imagination in the understanding of
urban infrastructures, especially those designed and built by engineers. It begins by defining
social imagination as image-based systems of representation and values that are shared by
various collective stakeholders concerned with infrastructure, such as engineers, but also
politicians, administrators, operators, maintenance technicians and indeed users, and then
introduces a tripartite model of infrastructure. Infrastructure is interpreted as the result of
the interactions between a material basis, professional organizations and stabilized sociotechnical
practices, and social imagination. The notion of network is interpreted from such
a perspective. Its dependence on imagination is outlined. Through two case studies, the
nineteenth-century networked metropolis, epitomized by Haussmann’s Paris, and the rise
of the contemporary smart city perspective, the role of social imagination in the conception
of urban infrastructure is analyzed further. What seems at stake in the transition towards
the smart city is the increased importance given to occurrences, events and scenarios as
the basis for urban infrastructure regulation. </td>

Redlining the Smart City </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> City governments are embracing data-driven and algorithmic planning to tackle
urban problems. Data-driven analytics have an unprecedented capacity to call urban
futures into being. At the same time, they can depoliticize planning decisions. I argue that
this shift calls urban studies scholars to investigate geographies of algorithmic violence––a
repetitive and standardized form of violence that contributes to the racialization of space
and spatialization of poverty. This article examines this broader phenomenon through the
case of a proprietary market value assessment that is being used to guide development in
cities across the United States. The assessment employs an algorithm that helps city officials
make critical decisions about which neighborhoods to target for investment, disinvestment
and public service upgrades or disconnections. I argue that the racial, infrastructural,
and epistemological violence associated with this evaluation can potentially lead to a
new kind of municipal redlining. The article brings insights from critical race theory into
conversation with critical scholarship on algorithms by analyzing how algorithmic violence
works through data-driven planning technologies to depoliticize and leverage power while
further entrenching racism and inequality. </td>

Reduction with Non‐positive Bidders: Is Choice
Modelling Consistent with Contingent Valuation? </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Riccardo Scarpa, Kenneth G. Willis </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2006 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The paper addresses the issue of consistency between two commonly
employed stated preference data—referendum contingent valuation (CV) and discrete
choice modelling (CM)—with respect to estimated distributions of individual willingness-to-
pay (WTP) for non-market goods. The policy context is that of a local externality:
effective speed reduction by means of traffic-calming in towns crossed by fast roads. In
particular, data from two independent samples of the same population are contrasted. The
findings show that both methods indicate that speed reduction via traffic-calming is
valued in a polarized fashion. Results from both methods are consistent with the presence
of two groups of preferences: a larger group holding positive values and a smaller one with
non-positive values. While the estimates of the relative proportions of the two groups are
similar across the two data sources, once the econometric analysis of the CM responses
allows for polarized preferences the estimates of the distribution of individual WTP differ
substantially. The results from the choice modelling survey indicate that residents are also
willing to pay for other benefits from traffic-calming, such as noise reduction and a
decreased waiting time for crossing, but preferences for these are also polarized, with WTP
for aesthetic improvements being positive only for those supporting effective speed control.
In comparing distributions of value estimates from CM and CV, surveys practitioners
should account for the effects of taste heterogeneity over externalities and take advantage
of the ability to derive individual-specific WTP estimates from panel estimation rather
than simply deriving estimates for common features of the WTP distribution. </td>

Netherlands, Denmark and Germany </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> John Pucher and  Ralph Buehler </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2008 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article shows how the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany have made
bicycling a safe, convenient and practical way to get around their cities. The analysis relies
on national aggregate data as well as case studies of large and small cities in each country.
The key to achieving high levels of cycling appears to be the provision of separate cycling
facilities along heavily travelled roads and at intersections, combined with traffic calming
of most residential neighbourhoods. Extensive cycling rights of way in the Netherlands,
Denmark and Germany are complemented by ample bike parking, full integration with
public transport, comprehensive traffic education and training of both cyclists and motorists,
and a wide range of promotional events intended to generate enthusiasm and wide
public support for cycling. In addition to their many pro-bike policies and programmes, the
Netherlands, Denmark and Germany make driving expensive as well as inconvenient in
central cities through a host of taxes and restrictions on car ownership, use and parking.
Moreover, strict land-use policies foster compact, mixed-use developments that generate
shorter and thus more bikeable trips. It is the coordinated implementation of this multifaceted,
mutually reinforcing set of policies that best explains the success of these three
countries in promoting cycling. For comparison, the article portrays the marginal status of
cycling in the UK and the USA, where only about 1% of trips are by bike. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In many cities of the world, road space is increasingly contested.
Growing vehicle numbers, traffic calming and the development of
new infrastructure for more sustainable transport modes such as
bicycles have all contributed to pressure on available space and
conflicts over the allocation of space. This paper provides the first
assessment of urban transport infrastructure space distribution,
distinguishing motorized individual transport, public transport,
cycling and walking. To calculate area allocation, an assessment
methodology was developed using high-resolution digital satellite
images in combination with a geographical information system to
derive area measurements. This methodology was applied to four
distinctly different city quarters in Freiburg, Germany. Results
indicate that space is unevenly distributed, with motorized
individual transport being the favoured transport mode. Findings
also show that if trip number to space allocation ratios are
calculated, one of the most sustainable transport modes, the
bicycle, is the most disadvantaged. This suggests that area
allocation deserves greater attention in the planning and
implementation of more sustainable urban transport designs. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sustainable land use planning creates a great challenge for rural road network planning. Further improvements of the
network are a necessity, to provide for people’s needs in the (near) future. Simultaneously, harmful effects of this network
conflict with the principles of sustainability. So, there is a need for a new planning approach, serving interests of both
accessibility and a sustainable environment. The spatial concept of the traffic-calmed rural area (TCRA) is presented as a
solution to this dilemma. This concept concentrates on the present diffused flows on minor rural roads at a few rural
highways, which resulted in a decrease of volumes and speeds within the region. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Many wildlife populations, particularly in urban areas, are in decline. This is in part due to a disconnection
between the lives of urban residents and native wildlife. The reconnection of social and ecological
systems by understanding the linkages between people’s attitudes and conservation behavior will help
improve conservation outcomes. This study investigated the attitudes of local communities toward koala
populations and sustainable wildlife conservation in southeast Queensland, Australia. Data was collected
using a questionnaire in face-to-face surveys (n = 102). Principal Component Analysis was used to quantify
attitude and action statements into key components. Further analysis of demographics and knowledge of
koalas was performed using analysis of variance and regression analysis. Results suggested that residents’
attitude toward koala conservation was strongly correlated with their home’s proximity to relatively
intact habitat. Residents living in peri-urban areas were significantly more likely than suburban residents
to have a positive attitude toward koala conservation, and be willing to participate in actions to
conserve koalas, such as traffic calming measures, community conservation schemes and support for
council-led conservation actions. These results highlight the importance of understanding variations in
community behavior toward biodiversity conservation in urban and peri-urban neighborhoods and suggest
that local governments and conservation groups use area of residence to target urban planning and
conservation initiatives more effectively. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2002 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The rural road network suffers continually from ambiguity. On the one hand, the presence of this network and its traffic
flows offer accessibility and make a contribution to economic development. While on the other, its presence and its traffic
flows cause fragmentation. The actual ecological impact of this fragmentation depends on several variables such as species
and road characteristics. This paper focuses on minor rural roads. The spatial concept developed to address this, ‘traffic
calming rural area’ (TCRA) is intended to address both accessibility and sustainable environment. It does this by concentrating
the current diffuse traffic flows on a few rural highways, thus, creating rural residential areas within the region. This paper
presents some formulae to quantify the resulting fragmentation. A more practical method compares the sizes of continuous
landscape units. Both the formulae and the method have been used for two pilot studies. The results indicate that
implementing the TCRA concept leads to larger continuous landscape units, thereby helping to reduce fragmentation effects. </td>

volumes and speeds) near urban settlements mitigates the population fragmentation of L. helveticus but
not that of A. obstetricans, indicating that even small roads with low-intensity traffic act as barriers for
the latter species. We suggest that the construction of passages for amphibians across rural roads would
potentially mitigate population fragmentation of endangered species like the anuran A. obstetricans. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This study quantifies the energy and environmental impact of a selection of traffic calming
measures using a combination of second-by-second floating-car global positioning system
data and microscopic energy and emission models. It finds that traffic calming may result
in negative impacts on vehicle fuel consumption and emission rates if drivers exert aggressive
acceleration levels to speed up to their journeys. Consequently by eliminating sharp
acceleration maneuvers significant savings in vehicle fuel consumption and emission rates
are achievable through driver education. The study also demonstrates that high emitting
vehicles produce CO emissions that are up to 25 times higher than normal vehicle emission
levels while low emitting vehicles produce emissions that are 15–35% of normal vehicles.
The relative increases in vehicle fuel consumption and emission levels associated with the
sample traffic calming measures are consistent and similar for normal, low, and high emitting
vehicles. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2017 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This study proposes a home-based walk trip generation model, based on the built environment
around households, controlling for sociodemographic influences. Two-stage hurdle
models are estimated based on a household travel survey in Portland, Oregon. The first
stage predicts the probability of households making any home-based walk trips. The second
stage predicts the number of home-based walk trips for the subset of households that
make such trips. The study also tests built environment variables for three different buffer
widths around household locations to see which scale best explains walking behavior. The
results show that sociodemographic characteristics are strong predictors of walk trip generation.
Specifically, household size, income, and number of workers in the household
influence the probability of a household having any walk trips, while household size and
number of children in the household affect the number of walk trips made by the subset
of households making walk trips. Characteristics of the built environment are also significant.
Activity density, transit stop density, employment accessibility, intersection density,
and most interestingly, sidewalk quality are associated with the decision to walk as a mode
of travel, while land-use entropy, transit stop density, employment accessibility, sidewalk
quality, and traffic calming and signal are predictors of the number of walk trips made by
households making walk trips. Sidewalk quality is represented by a single principal component
that neatly captures the common variance in an array of sidewalk variables. To
our knowledge, this is the first walk trip generation model to include a measure of sidewalk
quality. </td>

part of the road at the same time. When a car and an animal impact, two types of collisions can occur: ‘car hits animal’ and
‘animal hits car’. The probability of these events, and thus the probability of successful road traversing by animals, is determined
by road, traffic, vehicle, and species characteristics. Use of the model shows that, for the parameter ranges, traffic
volume and the animals’ traversing speed have the largest effects on whether a collision occurs. This model is applied to

almost all respondents were concerned about environmental issues, but their views did
not necessarily ‘match’ their travel behavior. Individuals’ environmental concerns only
had a strong relationship with walking within and near their neighborhood, but not with
cycling or public transport use. Residents’ car availability reduced public transport trips,
walking and cycling. The influence of urban design features on travel behaviors was mixed,
higher incidences of walking in denser, mixed and more permeable developments were not
found and nor did residents own fewer cars than the population as a whole. Residents did,
however, make more sustainable commuting trips than the population in general. Sustainable
modes of travel were related to urban design features including secured bike storage,
high connectivity of the neighborhoods to the nearby area, natural surveillance, high quality
public realm and traffic calming. Likewise the provision of facilities within and nearby
the development encouraged high levels of walking. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2005 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The urban environment and modes of transport are increasingly being linked to physical activity participation
and population health outcomes. Much of the research has been based on either health or urban
design paradigms, rather than from collaborative approaches. Previous health reviews in the urban design
area have been constrained to perceptions of the neighborhood or walking behaviors, consequently limiting
the understanding of built environment influences on physical activity modalities. This review focuses on
existing evidence surrounding various urban design factors and physical activity behaviors. Based on the
available evidence, fostering suitable urban environments is critical to sustaining physical activity behaviors.
In turn, these environments will provide part of the solution to improving population health outcomes.
Key urban design features attributable to transport-related physical activity are density,
subdivision age, street connectivity, and mixed land use. Future directions for research include consistent
use of transport and health measurement tools, an enhanced understanding of traffic calming measures, and
further collaborative work between the health, transport, and urban design sectors. Presenting these findings
to transport and urban design audiences may influence future practice, thereby increasing the sustainability
of health-related physical activity at the population level. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The city of Davis, CA, has a rich history of high bicycling levels, and the city has ambitious transportation
policies and goals. However, both the city of Davis and transportation scholars have overlooked the potential
opportunities a surplus of on-street residential parking provides to cities. The existing literature on the influence
of parking policy and provision has focused primarily on commercial districts and on large metropolises, neglecting
parking in more purely residential areas. In this descriptive case study, we systematically observed the
number of cars on a transect of residential streets in the early morning and late evening on weekdays to conservatively
estimate the average peak parking demand by residents as a percentage of available parking spaces.
On average, only 2 in 7 available parking spaces were occupied during peak hours. We note that the overprovision
of on-street parking in residential neighborhoods could be a nexus for the city to achieve its sustainable
transportation policy goals while addressing its fiscal and housing supply challenges. We discuss possible design
solutions, including providing ecosystem services, implementing traffic calming measures, and creating accessory
dwelling units. </td>

evaluating diferences in speed profiles obtained from various combinations of traffic calming measures. A
case study has been conducted in the City of York (UK) focusing on traffic calming measures such as speed
humps (flat-topped and round topped), speed cushions and chicanes implemented in sequence. Vehicles'
passing times were simultaneously recorded at 16 points along each traffic calmed link. From these data a
speed profile for each individual vehicle could be derived. An empirical model was developed using multiple regression analysis techniques based on data collected at three calibration sites. Speeds along these links
were described as a function of the input speed, the type of measure and the distance between measures.
The speed profile model was shown to be a good representation for the data from the calibration sites. It
efficiently predicted speeds of unimpeded vehicles over a given combination of traffic calming measures in
sequence. The validation process, based on data collected at three validation sites, also indicated that the
model provided a good representation of the observed profiles at these sites, with the exception of the
prediction of the effects of the chicanes on speeds. This type of measure was shown to produce diverse
impacts on speeds which depended on the detailed design. While the model is a useful design tool, recommendations have been made for further enhancement to it. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2011 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper reviews trends in cycling levels, safety, and policies in Canada and the USA over
the past two decades. We analyze aggregate data for the two countries as well as city specific
case study data for nine large cities (Chicago, Minneapolis, Montréal, New York,
Portland, San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, and Washington). Cycling levels have
increased in both the USA and Canada, while cyclist fatalities have fallen. There is much
spatial variation and socioeconomic inequality in cycling rates. The bike share of work
commuters is more than twice as high in Canada as in the USA, and is higher in the western
parts of both countries. Cycling is concentrated in central cities, especially near universities
and in gentrified neighborhoods near the city center. Almost all the growth in cycling in the
USA has been among men between 25–64 years old, while cycling rates have remained
steady among women and fallen sharply for children. Cycling rates have risen much faster
in the nine case study cities than in their countries as a whole, at least doubling in all the
cities since 1990. They have implemented a wide range of infrastructure and programs to
promote cycling and increase cycling safety: expanded and improved bike lanes and paths,
traffic calming, parking, bike-transit integration, bike sharing, training programs, and promotional
events. We describe the specific accomplishments of the nine case study cities,
focusing on each city’s innovations and lessons for other cities trying to increase cycling.
Portland’s comprehensive package of cycling policies has succeeded in raising cycling levels
6-fold and provides an example that other North American cities can follow. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The paper studies the factors that contribute to understand children's independent travel – i.e. not
being escorted by an adult – to and from primary school in Germany. Binary logit regression is
employed, and the data used are taken from a survey among parents of children in seven schools
in a medium-sized suburban town. This is the first paper from Germany that simultaneously looks
at the full range of dimensions that may help understand children's independent travel: (1) trip
characteristics, (2) child characteristics, (3) the household context, (4) subjective concerns, attitudes
and perceptions, (5) the transport environment, (6) the built environment and (7) the
social environment. In contrast to the majority of studies in the field, an attempt was made to
capture a holistic picture of the transport and land-use environment along the route, while at the
same time some key attributes of the route were used as separate variables. Perhaps the most
notable contribution to research is the distinct differences that we found between outward and
return trips. While the morning trip was characterised by distinct impacts of the built and
transport environment, most variables turned out insignificant in the afternoon model.
Conversely, more attitudinal dimensions turned out significant in the return trip. Some of our
findings are clearly relevant for policy. For instance, traffic calming is associated with higher
levels of independent travel, while routes characterised by industry and trade, high-speed roads,
and zebra-crossings that need to be crossed are associated with lower levels of independent
travel. The effects of perceptions and attitudes we find can be taken as starting points for soft
policies such as awareness campaigns or traffic education. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Enhancing the safety level of urban roads especially in CBDs is paramount. Due to a large
number of intersections in what is usually a grid road system in the CBDs, we investigate
crashes occurring in and around an intersection. The question of interest in this study is:
does the nature of crashes at intersections differ from those of the roads at midblock?
Stated more precisely, considering the intersection as a reference point, does the distance
to the reference point (i.e. midblock locations on the roads) correlate with different types of
crashes compared to that of the intersection? A right answer can lead traffic engineers and
safety auditors to propose different safety measures at intersections and the midblock locations.
As a pilot study, we collected the last 9 years crash data of the CBD of Melbourne,
Australia. For the first time, we employ Survival Analysis models -including Exponential,
Weibull, and Log-logistic- to investigate a space-dependent phenomenon (i.e. accidents
at proximity to the intersection). Of the outcome, highlights are: (i) police presence at busy
intersections during busy night outs and weekends highly improves the pedestrian safety
(ii) raised crossings at midblock locations lower likelihood of crashes of pedestrians as well
as cars, (iii) lighting conditions at intersections must be watched and kept at a high level.
(iv) Severity, likelihood, and location have no known association with the level of congestion.
In other words, safety is first, always and everywhere. The results can be of interest to
traffic authorities and policy makers in reinforcing traffic calming measures in the cities.
The codes developed in this study are made available to the research community to be used
in further studies. </td>

to either a class of random utility (RU) maximizers or a class of random regret (RR) minimizers,
on the basis of their sequence of observed choices. Our proposed model advances
the state of the art of RU–RR mixture models by (i) adding and simultaneously estimating a
membership model which predicts the probability of belonging to a RU or RR class; (ii)
adding a layer of random taste heterogeneity within each behavioural class; and (iii) deriving
a welfare measure associated with the RU–RR mixture model and consistent with
referendum-voting, which is the adequate mechanism of provision for such local public
goods. The context of our empirical application is a stated choice experiment concerning
traffic calming schemes. We find that the random parameter RU–RR mixture model not
only outperforms its fixed coefficient counterpart in terms of fit—as expected—but also
in terms of plausibility of membership determinants of behavioural class. In line with
psychological theories of regret, we find that, compared to respondents who are familiar
with the choice context (i.e. the traffic calming scheme), unfamiliar respondents are more
likely to be regret minimizers than utility maximizers. </td>

observe the behavior of 164 cyclists in Portland, Oregon, USA for several days each. Trip
purpose and several other trip-level variables recorded by the cyclists, and the resulting
trips were coded to a highly detailed bicycle network. The authors used the 1449 non-exercise,
utilitarian trips to estimate a bicycle route choice model. The model used a choice set
generation algorithm based on multiple permutations of path attributes and was formulated
to account for overlapping route alternatives. The findings suggest that cyclists are
sensitive to the effects of distance, turn frequency, slope, intersection control (e.g. presence
or absence of traffic signals), and traffic volumes. In addition, cyclists appear to place relatively
high value on off-street bike paths, enhanced neighborhood bikeways with traffic
calming features (aka ‘‘bicycle boulevards’’), and bridge facilities. Bike lanes more or less
exactly offset the negative effects of adjacent traffic, but were no more or less attractive
than a basic low traffic volume street. Finally, route preferences differ between commute
and other utilitarian trips; cyclists were more sensitive to distance and less sensitive to
other infrastructure characteristics for commute trips. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Promoting walking goes a long way in contributing to the sustainability and health of future cities and regions,
and improving pedestrian safety is essential for building more sustainable and healthier communities. As the
problem is multifaceted in nature, this study looks at patterns of pedestrian crashes from a perspective that goes
beyond the traditional investigation of pedestrian characteristics and behaviour by analysing the contribution of
built environment, land use, and traffic conditions. Moreover, this study goes beyond the traditional analysis of
traditional police reports by integrating them with rich geographic information system resources. This study
analysed a sample of 7469 crashes between a pedestrian and another road user that occurred in Denmark
between 2006 and 2015. The crash locations were geocoded and matched to a detailed traffic network, a
transport planning model, and several resources detailing building and land use composition. Latent class
analysis uncovered patterns of pedestrian crashes for both the fully identified records and the substantial amount
of hit-and-run records. Findings from this study reveal a major red thread in the lack of hazard awareness for
both pedestrians and road users and suggest solutions from both the behavioural and the infrastructure perspectives.
Major needs are (i) educating pedestrians about the risks related to drinking and then walking along
major roads in the darkness, (ii) making crossings for pedestrians and approaches for road users easier to understand
and to access in order to reduce unnecessary conflicts, and (iii) designing traffic calming solutions
around major shopping and leisure locations in dense city centres. </td>

investigates the effects of isolated traffic-calming measures at a corridor level and area-wide

traffic simulation model for a dense urban neighborhood is extended with capabilities for
microscopic emission estimation. The results indicate that on average, isolated calming
measures increase carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx)
emissions by 1.5, 0.3, and 1.5 %, respectively across the entire network. Area-wide schemes
result in a percentage increase of 3.8 %for CO2, 1.2 %for CO, and 2.2 %for NOx across the
entire network. Along specific corridors where traffic calming measures were simulated,
increases in emissions of up to 83% were observed. We also account for the effect of different
measures on traffic volumes and observe moderate decreases in areas that have undergone
traffic calming. In spite of traffic flow reductions, total emissions do increase. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 1994 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The economic and political reunification of Germany in 1990 unleashed a transportation
revolution in Eastern Germany. After forty years of public transport dominance under socialism,
auto ownership and use skyrocketed with the transition to capitalism. In only three years,
ridership on public transport fell by almost 50%, and auto registrations per 1,000 population
rose by almost 60%. The main reason for the sudden shift in modal split is the large increase
in real per-capita incomes of Eastern Germans. Their purchasing power rose dramatically thanks
to massive financial aid from Western Germany and access to hard currency for the first time.
In addition, the relative cost of auto use has fallen sharply since reunification because public
transport fares rose ten-fold, while gasoline prices and auto prices fell The massive shift from
public transport to the auto has caused severe problems of pollution, safety, equity, and
congestion in Eastern German cities, partly because of the suddenness of the modal shift. Urban
transport policy in Eastern Germany should adopt some of the strategies used for years in Western
Germany to tame the automobile, while at the same time allowing high levels of auto
ownership. Such strategies include auto-free zones, traffic calming, extensive bicycle pathways,
vehicle emission standards, and parking restrictions. Finally, large investments will have to be
made in Eastern Germany's dilapidated roadway and public transport infrastructure. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> An important aspect of area-wide traffic calming concepts is the integration of
major urban roads, because 70 to 80 percent of all urban accidents occur on major roads.
Traffic calming which is primarily based on the locational shift to such main thoroughfares
is socially injust, because -- in spite of all disturbances on those streets -- about one quarter
of the urban population live there. Social justice can only be somewhat achieved if the
expenditures for traffic calming and streetscaping are not used -- as today is most common
-- for accumulating the advantages in the low traffic side streets, but aimed at a partial
balance and compensation for the strains caused by car traffic on the major streets. Some
compensatory measures and new design principles will be discussed. Backgrounds are the
experience in six German model cities of area-wide traffic calming, several research projects
and the discussion about new guidelines for major urban roads. Where traffic and environmental
burdens focus, the concentration concept should be extended by compensatory
measures. That is the state of discussion in Germany examplified by nine topics. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Research on children's school travel behaviour has grown tremendously in the past decade, although Germany
has remained amazingly silent. At the same time the interplay between various factors that affect child travel is
not yet fully understood. The paper reports results from a survey in the medium-sized suburban town of Lünen,
Germany. Mode choice of children to and from primary school is studied using multinomial logistic regression.
The models include a large variety of variables that capture child and household sociodemographics, parents'
mode use, trip distance, parental concerns, attitudes and perceptions, and the built and transport environment.
Some of our results confirm previous studies (e.g. on the role of age, gender, and trip distance), while others
differ. For instance, we found no effects of household socioeconomic status or of the social environment on mode
choice. Concerning the role of the transport environment, we want to highlight two findings. Firstly, narrow
pavements along the route increase the odds of being driven rather than walking. Secondly, traffic calming is
associated with higher odds of cycling against walking. Parental attitudes and concerns also play a significant
role in child mode choice. </td>

acceptance of demand-restricting policy measures. Identification of such segments would allow policy
makers to better tail or their future actions and thereby increase the chance for a successful
implementation of the measures they propose. A set of 33 persons, selected in function of age, gender
and car ownership evaluated the acceptability of a total number of 42 demand-restricting policy
measures. Special care was taken that the final set of statements covered the four classically
distinguished demand-restricting strategies,i.e.,improved transportoptions, incentives for the use of
alternative transport modes, parking and land-use management, and institutional policy revision. In
addition, a balance between both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ and ‘push’ and ‘pull’ measures was strived for. The
results indicate that four different segments in terms of social acceptance of demand-restricting policy
measures can be distinguished, i.e., travelers in favor of traffic calming, travelers against hard push
measures, travelers in favor of demand restriction, and travelers against policy innovations. Besides the
differences and similarities between these segments, the practical implications for policy makers are
discussed, together with a series of specific recommendations and suggestions for future research. </td>

New legislation in Michigan provides economic (e.g. tax recapture) and legal (e.g. suspension of retroactive liability) incentives for local governments and prospective developers who are now seeking these brownfields instead of farmland and open space.  To evaluate land-use options with respect to brownfields inventory, characterization, and potential for redevelopment, both government and private decision-makers need access to information regarding land capability; development incentives; public goals, interests and preferences; and environmental concerns such as site contamination and environmental quality. This paper discuses a decision support system that provides access to state, regional, and local geospatial databases, several informational and visualization tools, and assumptions useful in providing a better understanding of issues, options, and alternatives in redeveloping brownfields. The resultant decision support system is augmented by a unique geographic information systems (GIS)-based land use modelling application called Smart Places as an integrated expert system. The decision support system is being tested in a city and county-level brownfield identification, screening, and marketing effort in Jackson County, Michigan. This project represents a testbed for decision-makers and policy analysts at all levels of government to establish urban land use policy and development guidelines that may be applicable to related land use issues in a variety of urban and urbanizing settings. While this project was conducted in Michigan, tools and procedures used are seen readily adaptable to other locations. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The relationship between sustainable urban development and environmental sustainability is crucial
to every strategy of urban transformation, renewal and regeneration. In particular, urban regeneration
entails programmes of urban transformation that involve the rehabilitation of existing parts of a city, reuse
previously built-up area and abandoned buildings, and redevelop blighted urban spaces to increase
urban sustainability. Few existing studies have evaluated the real environmental outcomes and effectiveness
of regeneration programmes in terms of physical variables such as newly provided green spaces,
access to public transportation, climate change or seismic-risk reduction.
This paper proposes a method for spatially quantifying the benefits of regenerating areas with reference
to environmental and urban factors, such as reduction of seismic risk, increase in accessibility and
diversity of land use. Each aspect is evaluated by spatial indicators, calculated at different geographical
units that steadily increase in size, in order to understand the effects of a single regeneration area and
of a number of concurrent areas. The work focuses on the municipality of Catania (Italy), a high-density
urban context, with a general lack of green spaces, and high levels seismic risk exposure.
Results show that positive benefits can be extended from regeneration areas to contiguous relevant
portions of the city, and that even a limited number of regeneration areas can produce relevant benefits.
These benefits rely on the combination of characteristics of regeneration areas and urban environments in
which they are located, such as population density, presence/accessibility of urban services, and land-use
diversity. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Current debates about urban sustainability tend to focus on technical issues, such as carbon emissions, energy consumption and waste management,
or on the economic aspects of urban regeneration and growth. Increasingly, however, governments recognise the contribution that built cultural
heritage makes to the social well-being of different groups living within increasingly cosmopolitan towns and cities. Heritage is seen as a major
component of quality of life, but the two main methods of identifying and protecting built heritage – the listing of individual monuments and
buildings and designation of conservation areas – are unable to deal with less tangible features of townscape, such as street patterns. Yet it is often
precisely these features that give a city its unique character and provide the sense of belonging that lies at the core of cultural identity. The purpose
of this paper, therefore, is to examine the role that built cultural heritage can play within sustainable urban development.
The paper considers changing definitions of built heritage before outlining the broad contribution it can make to sustainable urban development.
The paper then considers how the built environment contributes to the satisfaction of human needs by providing symbolic meanings that bind
cultural groups and communities across generations. Results from the development and application of a novel survey method, designed to assess
different people’s perceptions of and attitudes to urban historical areas, are presented before describing a case study of recent urban development in
Belfast that highlights the problems of intangible heritage. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of shortcomings of existing approaches to
urban regeneration and suggests how these might be overcome through a greater understanding of how people interact with the urban environment
and its heritage. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This study aims to explore the economic impacts of urban open spaces using the sales data of local small
businesses. A new urban park could attract more visitors and lead to neighborhood revitalization, especially in
distressed neighborhoods. In order to explore this mechanism, this study analyzes the case of the Gyeongui Line
Forest Park, a previously underutilized railroad that was converted to a linear urban park. A difference-indifference
approach was applied to evaluate the change in the sales of local businesses before and after the park’s
opening using credit card and cash sales data provided by the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s Big Data
Campus. The results showed that urban linear parks could have positive effects that lead to the neighborhoods’
economic vitality. However, the economic impacts could vary depending on neighborhood contexts. Specifically,
economically distressed neighborhoods could benefit more from the opening of a park. This study directly
captured the revitalization impact of the Gyeongui Line Forest Park using actual sales data instead of analyzing
indirect outcomes such as property values, thereby providing an alternative approach to measure the economic
impacts of parks. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Urban spatial development is a crucial issue for spatial planning and urban governance, ultimately determining
cities’ sustainability. While a set of spatial strategies to address urban development are progressively gaining
international consensus, their actual applicability is still contested. An interesting test-bed is represented by the
European Union (EU), where common spatial strategies have been discussed since 1993. This paper aims to
identify the main spatial strategies promoted at the EU-level and to investigate whether the recent spatial development
trends of EU cities have been following the directions suggested by the strategies. By analysing 30
policy documents, we identified six main strategies: compact city, urban regeneration, functional mix, no land take,
green city, and high density. For each strategy, we selected a set of indicators and applied them to the analysis of
175 cities representative of the variety of conditions across the EU.
Most cities progressed towards compact city and functional mix, but almost none halted land take. Urban
regeneration was more intense in Northern and Western cities, while Southern cities show the most significant
increase in green spaces. Growing cities achieved a higher density, but expanded inefficiently producing
abandonment of urbanized areas and fragmentation of agricultural land. Shrinking cities continued in the
paradox of contemporary population loss and expansion already observed by previous studies. The results
highlight potential conflicts and trade-offs in the implementation of the strategies. Similar analyses can stimulate
comparison, exchange, and cooperation among cities, thus supporting the mainstreaming of non-prescriptive
strategies formulated at the international level. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The notion and assessment of ecosystem services (ES) values is becoming an established part of the discourse
regarding urban green space performance. Yet, underlying factors enabling ES values are still poorly understood.
We assume the production of ES value crucial for environmental stewardship in cities, and aimed in this study to
uncover their key enabling factors. This study has been developed on a broad data base including a survey
(n =201), interviews (n =46), field observation and remote sensing from 27 urban gardens in Barcelona,
Spain, including municipal ‘allotment gardens’ and ‘civic gardens’ emerging from bottom-up initiatives. In a first
step, we distinguished different urban gardens types regarding the ES values they provide. In a second step, we
tested specific garden characteristics including (a) user profiles, (b) biophysical garden properties, and (c) institutional
settings for their specific importance to trigger ES values. Results showed ES values to significantly
differ with the types of gardens. For example, classical allotment gardens are more likely to provide recreational
values, while emerging civic gardens are more likely to produce place-making and social cohesion. A main
finding from our study is the importance of social and institutional garden characteristic as enabling factors of ES
values. Results indicate, for example, a correlation between childhood experiences and a higher appreciation of
ES. Our results further indicate that civic gardens with broader property rights and decision-capacities are more
likely to enhance stewardship action. In providing a differentiated understanding of the ES value(s) of urban
gardens, this study highlights the potential for green space planning in cities to steer the stewardship of urban
gardens by providing institutional and physical space for civic gardening initiatives. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2014 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Since the 1980s, the redevelopment of squatter housing settlements has been a primary policy focus of
the local and central authorities in Turkey. Their strategies have adopted two different models: one
approach was not effective at generating redevelopment activity and produced low quality living environments,
and the other approach resulted in dislocation and gentrification. The literature stresses three
issues. First, redevelopment sites are areas where market forces failed; thus, they are perceived as high
risk, low-demand, and low-return investments with high transaction costs. Second, institutions that
lower transaction costs boost market forces and increase economic performance in property development.
Third, local authorities remain active in urban redevelopment; despite having no direct tools for
local economic development, they do have tools for urban development. This study reformulates the
basic transaction cost thesis and hypothesizes that local authorities can boost urban redevelopment by
making changes to institutions or ‘the rules of the game’ by increasing information flow, positive externalities
and perceived returns and by decreasing transaction costs, negative externalities and risks, all of
which motivate land owners and house-builders. To test this hypothesis, I have conducted household surveys
and semi-structured interviews with house-builders in a squatter housing neighborhood undergoing
a gradual transformation. The goal of this study was to search for the impacts of the local authority’s
strategies on homeowner inertia, private sector disinvestment and the implications of urban redevelopment.
My findings revealed that the local authorities can produce desirable results for less attractive
neighborhoods with the help of marketing, institutional strategies and effective land use planning without
leading to dislocation and gentrification. Overall, this study suggests that ‘institutional’ strategies are
crucial for urban policies and future urban redevelopment activities. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article examines whether, and to what extent, the announcement of new urban regeneration plans has
influenced residential property values in Ulsan, Korea, where state-led initiatives have recently taken place to
revitalize urban core areas in a more incremental and participatory manner. This is accomplished by analyzing
data for single-family residential properties sold from January 2014 to December 2016 in the Ulsan Metropolitan
area. A sample of 7139 transactions is used for hedonic analysis with consideration of the detailed timing of plan
information dissemination from the beginning of the planning process to the release of the final plan. The results
showed that the urban regeneration strategic plan's release in December 2015 had a significant influence on the
values of residential properties within and around the project sites, but this influence varied across neighborhoods.
The effect of the plan release was found to be most significant in/around the project sites where residents
showed a high level of willingness to participate. In these areas, price escalations were found to occur even
before the release of the final plan, suggesting that appropriate planning interventions are required at early
stages of urban regeneration projects to protect vulnerable groups of residents from potential displacement. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> By analyzing data from the 2006/07 and 2013 French census as well as data extracted from the Yellow Pages,
this paper seeks to understand how the French city of Arles is preparing for the arrival of Frank O. Gehry’s Luma
Foundation landmark building in 2019, and how a big-scale construction site, still devoid of its future aesthetics
and cultural function, impacts the urban core. To do this, we consider three hypotheses: (1) The Rise of New
Audiences: a landmark building attracts the new populations to the pre-existing urban cultural core, (2)
Residential Pattern: a landmark building induces social transformation of surrounding neighborhoods, (3)
Mobility: a landmark building induces the arrival of the “most talented and educated” people. After testing these
hypotheses with cartographical and statistical methods, our findings demonstrate strong support for Mobility,
and mixed support for The Rise of New Audiences and Residential Pattern. Even though the causal links between
the landmark building and new urban dynamics are difficult to prove, our results reveal that Arles is “customizing”
itself to the forthcoming cultural and aesthetic dimensions of the Luma Foundation. </td>

great expectations from the European Capital of Culture 2010 Event. Sulukule, a Romani neighborhood
on the historical peninsula of Istanbul, was designated as an urban redevelopment zone. The
Sulukule Urban Regeneration Project is one of the recent efforts to present ‘‘a better urban environment’’

evictions and demolitions. Locals’ needs and rights are denied. Consequently, the citizens in Sulukule

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Culture permeates even the most imposing industrial building. Driven by global city making, city leaders
see culture as a key to bolstering a new economy and to dealing with decayed urban sites. However,
regional practices of creating creative strategies differ, as actors are not ‘‘dancing puppets” but actively
pursue their vested interests. The Red Town project in Shanghai is one example that represents the shift
from sporadic artistic action to organized construction and management of spaces for the creative industry.
This paper probes the development process of Red Town in order to uncover the power relationships
of a variety of actors in the urban regime. The pursuit of distinctiveness through selectively authentic
conservation and branding of artists’ offbeat taste, in return, offers benefits to several key players
involved, such as developers and government agents. However, when the link between artists and archaic
industrial buildings is legitimized, the resulting space becomes commercialized and, to an extent, discriminatory.
In this case, the architectural edifice celebrates economic growth, while at the same time,
it spurs the rise of unexpected social consequences. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In recent years, Shanghai has seen a surge of culture-led urban regeneration efforts. The paper discusses the
differentiated roles of artists in shaping Shanghai's three prominent arts districts. For simplicity of analysis and
illustration, visual artists and environmental designers were crudely categorized into elite and non-elite groups
depending on their exercised power in decision making in the transformation of the three sites. It was found that
arts production and urban regeneration, two tightly state-controlled fields in China, were increasingly linked
together in Chinese cities through capital circulation and conversion. Artists were a critical link of the two fields.
There was a clear stratification and fragmentation among Shanghai artists. Elite artists possessed huge amounts
of all types of capital, whereas non-elite members were disadvantaged on all fronts. In the field of urban regeneration,
artists were not simply used unconsciously as “catalysts” by property interest and regeneration officials,
but their elite segment also proactively helped reconstruct the physical and the symbolic urban spaces. The active
participation in the real estate sector by cultural entrepreneurs aided the conversion of esthetic proposition in the
arts field to culturally valorized spaces for sale in the urban regeneration field and this was enabled by the elite's
extensive connectionswith other powerful social agents in the business and the state sectors built over previous
experiences. For the non-elite artists, they participated in the transformative process unaware of their auxiliary
roles yet they had not acted as a collective critical force against the hegemonic growth regime. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Identity of a given place arises from a combination of social and cultural characteristics of the related community
which reincarnated in physical shapes and forms of the urban locality. Soaring growth of contemporary cities
beside recent transformations of traditional urban spaces have been caused some gaps between physical features
of urban environments and their cultural identities. This issue, accordingly, supports the need of special attentions
to the cultural and social aspects of transforming places under a process of urban design/planning. We
provide here an analysis framework with emphasis to the identity of the place from the cultural aspects of the
settlement. This technique mainly concerns to identify cultural features of the urban spaces and preserve them
during further urban regeneration. To this aim, representative factors of the places identity are hybridized with
the characteristic elements of cultural landscape and collected as a matrix of cultural landscapes, CLs. We
convinced from the analysis that it may be oversimplification if solely attention to the physical features for
improving quality of urban identity whiles it is affected by some nonphysical aspects, as well.
Provided matrix of CLs is also implemented for a test case. Some factors of cultural landscape are discovered
and the related effects on urban identity of designing place are discussed in micro and macro scales. Analysis
highlighted some tangible/intangible characteristics of the studied public urban area which have to be critically
considered through further transformation of the place. Accordingly, a preliminary design of the example
studying area is suggested as a green linkage space between natural area in countryside and cultural realms in
central parts of Mashhad city. </td>

can be done to remediate them and make them again safe and useful to society. This question is addressed in
post-socialistic city of Brno, the Czech Republic. Our research assesses public perceptions of such sites that are
currently utilized for the leisure time activities. Special attention is paid to public views of heritage preservation
as an option for brownfield regeneration. The principal aim of the paper is to measure public support of heritage
preservation through the conversion of brownfields to leisure activities and tourism. Data were gathered by
means of the questionnaire survey with visitors of four brownfields currently being used for leisure time activities
(n =130). It was revealed that the awareness of the visitors of the issue of brownfield regeneration is
very low, and that importantly affects the perception of heritage preservation of individual sites. Further, the
opinions of the respondents are significantly influenced by the local contexts of individual brownfields (predominantly
by the situation and the technical state). However, it might be stated that in locations where the
historical state of building has already been repaired, historical heritage is perceived more positively. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Understanding the relationship between population ageing and urban change has become a major issue for public
policy. An emerging theme has concerned the need to develop supportive urban communities for older citizens.
This paper provides a critical perspective on what has been termed the development of ‘age-friendly
cities and communities’ by exploring such policies in the context of urban change arising from globalisation,
urban regeneration and austerity. A key argument is that research and policies on age-friendly cities require
stronger integration with analyses of the impact of global forces transforming the physical and social context
of cities. This theme is developed by examining: first, the arguments behind the development of the ‘age-friendly’
approach; second, the pressures affecting urban environments, and their relevance for the ‘age-friendly’ debate;
and third, challenges for improving the urban environment for older populations. The article concludes by
discussing the need to combine a conceptual model of ‘age-friendliness’ with analysis of the economic and social
forces transforming urban environments. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper aims to broaden knowledge on policy governance of cultural districts, particularly those utilizing artist
communities for urban revitalization. With the rise of the cultural economy in post-industrial cities in South
Korea, cultural strategies have become key components in almost every urban regeneration project. The tactic
of encouraging groups of community artists to work and live in distressed neighborhoods has been regarded
as a low-budget and easy-to-implement tool for urban revitalization. Over the past few years, however, these
strategies have failed to meet expectations and have often resulted in conflicts between artists and the
government. To understand the factors behind the strategies' positive and negative consequences, this paper
examines three projects with different degrees of government intervention: the Totatoga project in Busan City,
the Daein Art Market project in Gwangju City, and the Changdong Art Village project in Changwon City. The
analysis focuses on the mode of government intervention in the relationships among the government, artists,
intermediary agencies, and local citizens. By putting the mode of government intervention in the context of social
relations of related players in the cultural districts, this paper tries to understand how similar policy schemes
created different consequences. </td>

forced public housing relocations </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> We examine the contradictory practices of care surrounding forced relocation of public housing residents. Our
case study is the Ivanhoe public housing estate, located in Sydney, Australia. In 2015 the New South Wales State
Government announced that the estate would be redeveloped and all residents relocated. We explore two separate,
yet inter-connected, scales of care. First, we explore how policy and program spaces were opened up
during the relocation process, allowing care practices to be enacted. Second, we explore the care practices of
relocation officers. We examine how relocation officers went “above and beyond” to care for residents at a
stressful period in their life. However, we argue that the practices do not meet the definition of care put forward
by Tronto (1993) as they do not “maintain, continue, and repair” on an ongoing basis. Rather, we argue that care
has been mobilised as a means of efficiently facilitating relocation and redevelopment. The process of forced
relocation cancels existing care spaces and practices. Care practices emerge as tools of a neoliberal government
seeking to relocate a disadvantaged community in an effort to facilitate public-private development. These care
practices result in dispossession, which benefits private and government interests via redevelopment. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper takes a look at the implementation of policies under shrinkage conditions using the example of one of
the largest federally supported urban policies in Germany. The Urban Restructuring Programme was initiated in
the year 2001 as a response to the problem of extraordinarily high vacancies in the eastern part of the country.
While earlier publications on the subject suggested that this policy was predominantly oriented towards demolition
of vacant units, in this paper it is argued that this view should be revised. It is demonstrated that both the
problem of housing vacancies and policy responses were substantially differentiated regionally. Further, it is
highlighted how the policy has gradually changed over time, as its focus shifted from demolitions towards a
new approach which seeks to adapt the mechanisms of urban regeneration to the conditions of shrinkage. Finally,
the question is asked to what extent the new approach will turn out to be successful in the light of current demographic
trends in Eastern Germany. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Baltic city of Gdansk is world famous, having repeatedly played an important role in history: it was
one of the dominant members of the Hanseatic League, it was the place where the first shots of the Second
World War were fired and, as the birthplace of the Solidarity movement, it became an icon of resistance
against communist rule east of the Iron Curtain. Today, like other large Polish cities, Gdansk has
to manage the challenges of being a late-comer in the international community of competing cities, yet
undoubtedly also having to cope with the legacy of the last one and a half decades: an absence of efficient
city policies in vital areas. City image-building involves the task of integrating a multicultural past.
Challenges such as profound socio-economic and demographic change, notably an aging and shrinking
population, and the resulting spatial repercussions such as suburbanisation and the need for inner city
revitalisation – these in conjunction with the need for modernisation of the port and of the economic
base – demand fresh strategies in the new context of EU funding opportunities. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Tbilisi, a city of over a million, is the national capital of Georgia. Although little explored in urban studies, the city
epitomizes a fascinating assemblage of processes that can illuminate the interplay of geopolitics, political choices,
globalization discourses, histories, and urban contestations in shaping urban transformations. Tbilisi's strategic
location in the South Caucasus, at the juncture of major historical empires and religions in Eurasia, has ensured
its turbulent history and a polyphony of cultural influences. Following Georgia's independence in 1991, Tbilisi
found itself as the pivot of Georgian nation-building. Transition to a market economy also exposed the city to economic
hardship, ethnical homogenization, and the informalization of the urban environment. The economic recovery
since the early 2000s has activated urban regeneration. Georgia's government has recently promoted
flagship urban development projects in pursuit of making Tbilisi as a modern globalizing metropolis. This has
brought contradictions, such as undermining the city's heritage, contributing to socio-spatial polarization, and
deteriorating the city's public spaces. The elitist processes of decision-making and a lack of a consistent urban
policy and planning regimes are argued to be among major impediments for a more sustainable development
of this city. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Retail activity in Portugal is undergoing tremendous changes. New forms of commercial development,
such as shopping centers and hypermarkets, have been built in locations far from the
traditional shopping districts, and normally near a major road or highway intersection. This
out-of-town commercial development has impacts on traditional forms of retail in established
city centers. This article analyzes ways in which retail planning and city center commercial
revitalization can be used to make Portuguese city centers more livable for city dwellers. Its
main objective is to categorize, evaluate and compare the actions proposed by two commercial
urbanism projects in Portugal. This study uses the cities of Coimbra and Aveiro to discuss the
hypothesis that the measures proposed under the PROCOM program will help to revitalize
Portuguese city centers. The key finding is that commercial revitalization is crucial for the

designed capital of the newly-born Turkish nation-state. The early episode of the city’s growth displayed
a typical example of modernization with the hand of a determined nationalist government. Yet, the second
half of the century, also similar to other developing parts of the world, witnessed the uncontrollable
expansion of the city with the emergence of squatter areas. Providing a brief discussion of this history, the
article focuses on the recent developments in Ankara’s urban growth, which was marked by an original
trend in urban politics. A significant combination of neoliberal development strategies and Islamist social
welfare policies has emerged in the Turkish cities in the last two decades. Ankara, being the symbol of
republican modernization distinguished with a radical interpretation of secularism, suffers this political
tension and witnesses the social predicaments of an immense transformation shaped by urban regeneration

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Over the past 50 years, housing advocates have aggressively lobbied for the deconcentration of pockets of
poverty in urban areas. These efforts have been welcomed by those who seek to bring new life to these
areas through the implementation of urban revitalization strategies, such as the introduction of new
mixed use and income developments. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s HOPE
VI program is based on these principles. Federal funds have been used to demolish public housing in areas
of concentrated poverty to make way for mixed use development. While much is known about the effect
of displacement on the original occupants of the demolished housing, little is known about the experiences
of the residents who are able to move back to these revitalized areas. Employing a case study
approach, this research seeks to understand the attitudes of the original residents of a public housing
community in Beaumont, Texas, as they return to new housing opportunities on and in the vicinity of
the redeveloped site. The findings of this five year study reveal a sense of optimism by the residents
who have returned about the future of the slowly transitioning neighborhood. Specifically, they cite great
satisfaction with the new developments and a strong belief that, because of the HOPE VI redevelopment,
the neighborhood will eventually become more prosperous. The degree to which this optimism will be
supported by actual neighborhood change is presently undetermined. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 1999 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cities, and in particular historic cities, are recognised as valuable resources within the increasingly
competitive and integrated European economy. This paper focuses on the experiences of
two such cities, Edinburgh and Prague, contrasting different approaches in local planning and
urban regeneration policy. Edinburgh, like other western European capitalist cities, has a long
tradition of strategic planning and policy making, engaging with a broad range of policy stakeholders
and local interest groups. In contrast, the city of Prague highlights some of the difficulties
faced by post-socialist cities as they adapt to the economic forces of the European Union
and globalisation. Limited attention has been given to how post-socialist cities have managed
to come to terms with such forces and reconcile competing national and local trends. In the
paper, key issues identified in Prague refer to the fragmentation of local government, the lengthy
nature of re-establishing property ownership and procedural difficulties with the planning
system. These problems have effectively hindered the formulation of a strategic framework for
future urban planning, and have led to a lack of co-operation between decision makers in the
city. The comparison between the experiences of east and west clearly highlights the necessity
of re-focusing on the relationship between the planning system and its specific context of
governance structures. Planning historic cities is a necessary factor to ensure that sustainable
development is achievable, and to secure an advantageous position within the emerging European
hierarchy. Post-socialist cities can do more by learning from the experience of urban
Europe, as East looks West. </td>

experiences from Liverpool </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2006 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The control of urban sprawl is one of the key issues challenging planners in many countries.
Whilst a substantial discourse has developed in North America, it is also a matter of key concern
for British and European planners, although here the debate is often expressed in terms
of urban containment and the search for compact cities. This article considers the development
of policies for the control of urban sprawl within the British planning system and examines
their implementation and effectiveness within one city region: the Liverpool conurbation.
Despite the considerable achievements of British policy in controlling urban sprawl and
encouraging urban regeneration over the last two decades, there remain some doubts as to
how much further market forces can be directed towards the production of more compact cities.
In particular, a number of commentators, notably Breheny [Urban compaction: feasible
and acceptable? Cities 14 (1997) 209–217], have raised doubts about the feasibility and acceptability
of urban compaction to populations whose main housing location aspiration is for suburban
living. Evidence in this paper is drawn from the analysis of secondary data for the
Liverpool conurbation as well as the results of surveys of recently moving households carried
out by the authors. This evidence suggests that despite recent progress, these market forces
continue to represent a major challenge to policy makers in promoting the compact city. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper examines a neighborhood regeneration effort in Jangsu Village, Seoul, through which residents strived
to continue living in the area on the verge of whole sale renewal. In Seoul, a large-scale urban development and/or
regeneration has shaped urban fabric since the 1960s, while the recent phenomenon of rapid aging has led to a
sudden demographic shift. Jangsu is a low-income, dilapidated neighborhood in the center of Seoul where many
inhabitants are aging long-terms quatters. Therefore, this research provides a glimpse into how older inhabitants
with fewer resources are able to continue living in their neighborhood in a gentrifying city undergoing rapid spatial,
socio-economic and population changes. The paper demonstrates how neighborhood social capital has fostered multi-stakeholder collaboration and the participation of older residents in the area's regeneration, enabling
residents to continue living there and improving living conditions by repairing and reusing existing buildings.
Thereby, this paper highlights: (1) neighborliness as a significant dimension in making age-friendly cities and,
(2) the notion that age-friendliness might serve as an urban regeneration framework, emphasizing stable and affordable
residency as well as progressive transformation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Culture-led urban regeneration has been the buzzword of many cities around the world nowadays. There are two
related ways to interrogate this problematic. First, it is about the extent to which it is a real urban future for cities.
Second, it is about its applicability to cities other than those in the West. This article attempts to tackle these related
queries by, first, invoking Lefebvre's concepts of utopia vs isotopia and, then, drawing on two cases of cultural
regeneration in an industrial district and an old residential neigbourhood in Hong Kong. The conceptual
discussion of utopia highlights the imperative of spatial contradictions as the prerequisite for the emergence of
concrete utopia; otherwise, it only results in isotopia. As such, it is difficult for cultural regeneration to produce
utopia. This, in turn, calls for greater attention to the historical–geographical processes that have produced
the conditions for the concerned city. It is these processes that differentiate Hong Kong from many others in
the West. The prevailing land (re)development regime has favoured some processes at the expense of others.
The two empirical cases have confirmed that either spatial contradictions were not there, or if they ever emerged,
they were time and space specific. These conditions rendered it difficult to nurture creativity and to really relegate
the decision-making power to the people, thereby denying the possible applicability of the problematic of
cultural regeneration to Hong Kong. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The paradigm of urban development policy of Seoul has changed from wholesale redevelopment to cultural
regeneration since the 2000s. While many cultural regeneration projects are led by the city government and
supported by public funds, the presence of cultural entrepreneurs in Itaewon, a camp town in central Seoul, has
led cultural regeneration of old neighborhoods through their artistic pursuits combined with entrepreneurial
practices. Contrary to the social recognition that revitalization of Itaewon would be difficult without relocating
military bases within the area, Itaewon is undergoing a rapid transformation from a camp town to a culturally
vibrant neighborhood. In this paper, cultural entrepreneurs refer to artists who pursue not only cultural works
but also entrepreneurial practices as business owners. Though many cultural entrepreneurs are regarded
as symbolic precursors of gentrification displacing low-classes residents including themselves, cultural
entrepreneurs in Itaewon led the revitalization of old neighborhood by reimagining its negative image
into culturally vibrant space, identifying themselves as residents, and having self-awareness of becoming
precursors of gentrification. </td>

last 20 years. It examines the process by which a cultural strategy was developed to assist urban
and economic development objectives in Bristol, UK. Bristol, the primary regional centre in the
west of England, is a city which has only comparatively recently given serious attention to the
cultural sector as a resource for urban regeneration. As it has unfolded, the cultural strategy
has displayed a striking capacity to act as a catalyst for partnership on several different levels.

economy; however, prolonged phases of devaluation can have serious economic consequences. The purpose
of this paper is to apply resilience theory to the area of urban revitalization in a US southwest context
and to identify sets of recommendations and traps to be avoided in future urban revitalization
interventions. The main argument is that the creation of two new centralities in Tempe has weakened
the vibrancy of the Mill Avenue district, even despite the new streetscape improvements and the light
rail induced development efforts on Apache Boulevard. The key finding is that downtowns need to be
nurtured through the use of urban design practices and community-oriented planning decisions; otherwise

country's industrialization under the developmental state. Over the past twenty years however, it has been badly
hurt by South Korea's overall slowing down of the economy and population growth. Its key challenges are
deindustrialization, population decline, and rising socio-spatial inequality with suburbanization promoting declining
inner-city centers – all strikingly similar symptoms shared by many former industrial cities struggling to
find a new niche in the global economy. This city profile identifies multi-level policy responses that have sought
to revive Daegu and confront its urban shrinkage, under South Korea's relatively recent policies of democratization

one of pro-growth strategies and another, more inclusive, regenerative approach. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Urban regeneration is a complex and multi-faceted process. It can be defined a comprehensive and integrated
vision of actions which aims to tackle urban problems and to improve the economic, social and environmental
conditions. These strategies also involve several stakeholders which have different powers, interests and objectives
in the transformation processes. Integrated evaluation tools are able to consider the multidimensionality
of the urban context and the feedback of the different actors involved. These tools are mainly of use for the
decision makers. This paper explores the use of Community Impact Evaluation (CIE) which is a multi-actor
methodology that aims at defining the convenience of complex projects according to the social preferences
expressed by different members of the community. In this paper, the CIE methodology is applied in a peculiar
way in order to assess the different impacts generated by the 22@ Barcelona project, considering the effects at
the different scales and over time. A synthetic analysis is conducted in order to estimate the nature and the
intensity of the impacts among the different stakeholders. The evaluation shows the role of economic interest in
urban regeneration processes and how the change in the political local context allowed a review of project. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Both scholars and policy makers have noted the growing issue of poverty and deprivation during China's rapid
urbanization. Often previous studies examine the spatial distribution of deprivation in inner cities and suburban
areas, but fail to assess the whole region. Moreover, the cross-sectional nature of these studies is unable to
discover its changes over time. This research aims to evaluate multiple deprivation in the administrative area of
Guangzhou and its evolution from 2000 to 2010. Using the Fifth and Sixth Censuses, this study is based on 2643
neighborhood committees and 167 sub-districts (or towns) of inner city, suburban areas, and outer areas of
Guangzhou. During the decade, there was persistent multiple deprivation in some areas of the inner city. The
deprivation improved in suburban areas, but urban villages experienced deteriorating deprivation. Although
urban-rural disparity became smaller in the outer areas, there were still some worst-hit neighborhoods. The
evolution of multiple deprivation is collectively affected by institutional factors (including the dichotomous

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cities have started adapting to uncertain climate drivers such as temperature and sea level rise, and some cities
are also transitioning towards concepts such as Water Sensitivity. In adaptation planning, flexibility is considered
as an important characteristic to respond to changing circumstances. This paper develops a novel approach
to identify where flexibility can best be embedded in urban flood risk management systems. The identification
of a flexible water sensitive adaptation response is based on change propagation; i.e. the response's
ability to minimise negative or maximise positive impacts in urban systems. The Flexible adaptation planning
process (WSCapp), comprising change propagation – especially how positive and negative impacts propagate in
an urban environment, can be used by those concerned with urban planning and urban adaptation to identify
“where” the flexible adaptation responses can be implemented. WSCapp can be used to decide the type of
adaptation response such as changes to streetscape, place making or architectural forms that can best contribute
towards the objectives of a water sensitive city. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> How to make a better use of derelict industrial sites mostly occupied by state-owned enterprises has presented an
increasing challenge to urban regeneration of many Chinese cities. Drawing from the experiences of a landmark
project (Xinyi Club) in Guangzhou City, this study examines the course of adaptive reuse of an industrial land
and its repercussions on reshaping the urban renewal strategy of the city. We argue that industrial land restructuring
requires a pragmatic partnership of the local state with the occupiers and market players, and its
flexible decision-making to overcome the constraints of regulatory institutions. Urban regeneration strategy of
Chinese cities requires some fundamental transformations of the governing institutions and systems to remove
the barriers against bottom-up initiatives in order to expedite the pace of redevelopment. First-mover advantage
of the project proponents and the support of local government accounted for the success of the development
project in this study. It may not be easily replicable because it is an outcome of exception rather than norm. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper examines waterfront revitalization in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Unlike many contemporary
North American cities, heavy industry continues to dominate the local economy, and
the physical manifestations of this industry (mills, smokestacks, and industrial air and water pollution)
remain visible along Hamilton’s harbourfront. Within the last three decades, major
investments in improving the city’s environment – and reputation – have been undertaken within
the city, including the Hamilton Harbour Waterfront Trail, opened to the public in 2000. This
paper uses newspapers and municipal documents to track the development of the Trail, from
the initial planning of the Trail until the present day. These sources suggest that the proposal
and subsequent development of the waterfront trail are linked to broader discourses of environmental
and economic revitalization within and beyond the city. In addition, issues of access and
inclusiveness are highlighted. These results draw attention to the ways that waterfront development
is both locally situated and moulded by broader discourses and trends. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2013 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gwangju is a metropolitan city located in the southwest of the Republic of Korea. The city was relatively
socio-economically underdeveloped compared to other major Korean cities, particularly cities in the capital
region and the southeast, until the 1980s. The central government’s former efficiency-oriented economic
development policies, which focused on specific strategic locations in Korea, account for this
underdevelopment. From the 1990s onward, Gwangju promoted its economic growth by constructing
industrial complexes and establishing photonics and optical industries. Although the city has achieved
some significant results in creating high-tech industries, Gwangju has the potential for further development.
This is supported by the fact that since 2004, Gwangju, jointly with the central government, has
begun an urban development project, the Hub City of Asian Culture Gwangju Project, to transform the
city into an international city of arts and culture. The project represents more geographically balanced
policy on the part of central government, as well as local government incentive to find urban regeneration
strategies so the central city will be capable of thriving in the post industrial world. However, there are
conflicts related to this project, particularly as regards the construction of the Asian Culture Complex
(ACC). The success of the project will be dependent upon the construction of the ACC, which will be
the most important facility. </td>

policy and development. Furthermore, urban planning is recognised as an important instrument for promoting
sustainable development. The purpose of this study is to examine how Finnish central business
district developments are designed to facilitate environmental sustainability. Three recent urban regeneration
projects are explored as a multiple case study, firstly to model the central business district development
process in Finland, and secondly to analyse how the expected outcomes of such regeneration
projects support environmental sustainability. Official plan reports and supplementary case data are analysed
qualitatively. A common development process model is identified and environmental sustainability
is found to be promoted through higher urban density. However, environmental considerations are made
only in the beginning and at the end of the linear planning process. In each of the cases studied, the
contribution to environmental sustainability appears to be scarce. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The use of location based social networks—LBSNs—for diagnosing phenomena in contemporary cities is evolving
at a fast pace. However, methodological frameworks for informing urban regeneration at a fine-grain
neighborhood scale through LBSNs is still by and large an unchartered territory, which this research seeks to
address. This research bridges the knowledge gap by proposing a method to identify urban opportunity spaces
for urban regeneration that involves pre-processing, analyzing and interpreting single and overlapped LBSN
data. A two-fold perspective—people-based and place-based—is adopted. Data from four LBSNs—Foursquare,
Twitter, Google Places and Airbnb—represent the people-based approach as it offers an insight into individual
preferences, use and activities. The place-based approach is provided by an illustrative case study. Local unexpected
nuances were gathered by the interlinking of data from different LBSNs, and opportunity places for
urban regeneration have been recognized, as well as potential itineraries to boost urban liveliness and connectivity
at both intra and inter-neighborhood scales. Findings show that overlapping data from various LBSNs
enriches the analysis that would previously have relied on a single source. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper will explore the politics of waterfront development as it emerged around Cork’s
preparation and tenure of the 2005 European Capital of Culture. Many cities in recent decades
have encouraged the cultural sectors and the arts as a pathway for urban regeneration. As this
strategy unfolded in Cork, the festival enabled new modes of urban entrepreneurial governance
to be practiced and new visions of the city projected. Informed by current debates
on neo-liberal urban strategies in North American and European cities, the paper explores
how these urban strategies were articulated by elite actors, who attempted to appropriate
the European Capital of Culture event to support their growth plans for the city, and the docklands
in particular. The paper then considers how this pro-growth urban imaginary was contested
as it clashed with the experience and expectations of the local arts scene. We argue
that an exploration of the strategies for the dockland and the 2005 European Capital of Culture
event offers us a way into understanding how economy and culture are inscribed upon the
Irish urban landscape. </td>

particular challenge in post-conflict areas, where among the sustainability factors /economical, ecological and
social/, the social one is the least represented, and at the same time the most important one due to the disrupted
social structure. In this paper industrial heritage, which is thought to be a heritage category unburdened by
issues resulting from a conflict, is discussed as a potential catalyst in conducting a successful socially sustainable
urban regeneration in post-conflict contexts. The hypothesis states that endangered industrial heritage sites, due
to their societal, historical, architectural, and technological values, present a fruitful base for incorporating
sustainability principles and can be seen as a catalyst for urban regeneration of post-conflict areas in the future. </td>

However, how the governance change actually takes place in the planning system needs careful substantiation
and contextualisation. By applying the ‘levels of governance’ concept, this paper examines diverse
factors of governance innovation with a reference to the recent participatory urban regeneration policy in South
Korea. Through multi-scalar analysis of the comparative case studies of three districts in the city of Daegu, we
explain a combination of various factors at the local level that has a significant influence on governance innovation.
We also highlight that governance innovation is engendered on the basis of the material and relational
resources available at other spatial scales and involves multi-scalar institutional restructuring. This multi-scalar
dimension would broaden our understanding of what makes governance change possible and how it takes place. </td>

from an analysis of the Iniciativa Urbana (2007–2013) </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2017 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Urban issues have been targeted by European Union (EU) policy action during the last three decades.
The launch and implementation of the URBAN (1994–1999) and URBAN II Community Initiatives
(2000–2007) introduced an innovative way of addressing urban challenges in many
Member States, resulting in a relevant advancement in the field of urban regeneration.
With the end of the URBAN Community Initiative for the programming period 2007–2013, the urban dimension
of EU policy was mainstreamed in the Operational Programmes of the Member States, giving
them the chance to implement integrated urban regeneration initiatives in their cities by putting into
practice the “URBAN method”.
This work stems from the recognition of the relevant contribution that the EU urban policy, and
particularly the two rounds of URBAN, have made to urban regeneration in Spain, and aims to
understand how the “URBAN method” was developed in the new scenario for 2007–2013
through the Iniciativa Urbana (the initiative launched by the Spanish Government to continue
the transformative trend started by URBAN). This study focuses on understanding how this
new instrument assumed and fostered the collaborative, integrated and innovative approach of
URBAN as advised by the European Commission (EC). It also aims to understand whether through
this instrument, the urban dimension of EU policy is contributing to face the traditional problems
inherent to urban regeneration in the country.
In order to achieve the mentioned objectives, this study analyzes the launch of the Iniciativa Urbana
(IU) by the Ministry of Finance on a national scale in 2007 and two IU programmes implemented
in the region of Madrid (Leganés-La Fortuna and Madrid-Villaverde) through the
development of case studies.
The study shows that the Iniciativa Urbana is not making relevant progress if compared with the
programmes undertaken under URBAN II regarding the development of integrated, collaborative
and innovative urban regeneration strategies. It also shows that it is leaving unsolved and partially
unaddressed traditional problems regarding action in the urban environment in the country.
The conclusions contribute to a reflection on the framework of the development of the
Urban Agenda for Spain (at the moment in progress) and to a first assessment of the
mainstreaming of the urban dimension in EU policies from 2007 in the context of the Member
States. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In the last decade, scholars and policymakers have paid greater attention to the role of famous designers’
pieces of architecture not only in regenerating urban areas but also in defining a positive and communicative
image in the global economic competition among cities. Taking into account the general background
of and socio-economic changes in Western countries, this rationale assumes that the use of a
well-known architect’s name can give a competitive advantage to a city in many ways. Following this
legitimizing narrative, cities now strive for signature architecture, sometimes with little regard to their
urban context, their size and role in the global market, the democratic decision making process and
the urban effects. Although moderate success in urban regeneration, tourist attraction and economic
development may be achieved in some cases, the high expectations of policymakers are often not met.
In this sense, a better understanding of this urban issue is relevant for the current debate on urban planning.
The manuscript draws on an extensive case study of Abu Dhabi, describing the local institutional
framework and planning system, analyzing the oligarchic network and key actors in urban development
and providing an in-depth analysis of the Saadiyat Island mega-development project, which includes a
cultural district, hotel, retail and residential areas, with spectacular architecture. The local economic
and institutional conditions of Abu Dhabi are not common elsewhere, but the city is a significant case
of the political, economic and urban criticalities of planning large scale development projects and of
collecting pieces of branded architecture in a democratic vacuum. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Industrialized countries suffer from the negative influence of decline in their traditional retail districts with the
rapid increase of online sales and out-of-town shopping developments. Upon recognising these problems, governments
have responded to the decline of traditional retail districts with retail-led urban regeneration. Although
there are many case studies on urban regeneration projects, most of them primarily focus only on good or successful
cases, despite the fact that the exploration of a bad or unsuccessful case can provide more insight into
failed projects. This study aims to examine the lessons that can be learned by comparing good and bad practices
for accomplishing successful urban regeneration projects in traditional retail districts. Using the survey data from
the Small and Medium Business Administration (SMBA) of the Republic of Korea in 2014, we identify good and
bad practices for comparison through an integrated approach using both quantitative and qualitative methods.
We find that good practices are focused on self-sufficiency improvement; conversely, bad practices are based
on the development of supportive government policies to benefit the revival of the districts. For the successful
promotion of a retail-led regeneration strategy, a supporting system, such as a policy, is necessary to bring
about the cooperation and sharing of a common goal for long-term business results to be derived at the policy
level. </td>

transport, housing, economic development and urban conservation/regeneration. The article
assesses the current attempts by the city to implement a strategic plan for the capital, and
comments on its future prospects. Considerable attention is currently focused upon Lisbon
given its recent role as European City of Culture in 1994, and the urban regeneration initiatives
associated with Expo 1998. Expo offers the possibility of improving and integrating the eastern
side of the city with its central area and waterfront. The project is also linked to the construction

restructuring also means deep social changes. Madrid’s socio-spatial configuration is
becoming more segregated, with the recent evolution of the real estate industry one of the
key issues of the process. In this context, different social groups have understood some of
the urban projects implemented by the local and regional administrations as posing a danger
to urban projects implemented by the local and regional administrations as posing a danger to
urban segregation in the city. The article analyses social mobilization in a central neighborhood
where an ambitious urban regeneration project is being developed. Since 1997, a social
mobilization is in progress against a plan that could mean the first step of a gentrification process.
A very diverse set of social groups (immigrants associations, squatters, ONG, cultural
associations, etc.) joined to create the Red de Colectivos de Lavapie´ s [add diacritical] (Lavapie
´ s, Groups Network). Over the last few years the evolution of the mobilization has favored
a process of convergence with other social organizations and, finally, they have developed a
critique of the overall transformation of Madrid, seen as excessively oriented towards middle

for Moscow has had to adapt to the collapse of the Soviet system, meet public expectations
of more democratic processes, and meet the demands of a free market economy. This article
examines the significance of the Soviet legacy, recent changes in the legal, administrative and
urban governance framework for planning, and strategic planning issues facing the metropolis.
After a preoccupation for decades of trying to restrain the growth of Moscow, its planners are
now attempting to address the prospect of continued population decline and other urban issues
which are now characteristic of large capitalist cities. The article concludes that Moscow is at
a critical turning point, moving from being a socialist to a capitalist city. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2012 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Throughout the late 20th and early 21st Centuries, culture has gained increasing importance in strategies
designed to deal with new trajectories of urban areas. Post-industrial cities seek to revive former industrial,
contaminated and waterfront sites and their city centers, as they are aiming to establish themselves
in the new arena of the global market place.
This paper looks at the relationships between investments in cultural resources/activities and urban
regeneration processes, and in this respect, how culture can be considered a determinant to the accumulation
of human and social capital. It examines the transformation of the Saint Michel district located in
metropolitan Montreal. The Saint Michel area is experiencing a radical change in its social, economic and
environmental profile due to its transition from the industrial-led development model to the post-industrial
model in which investments in cultural and creative activities/industries – particularly the headquarters
of Cirque du Soleil and TOHU – La Cité des Arts du Cirque – are supplying new opportunities
for the local area in a metropolitan dimension. What impacts does such clustering have on the social
and human capital of the vast majority of the populations that live within this area?
Based on a theoretical review and empirical investigation, the paper presents some clarification of the role of cultural investment in the definition of an emerging sustainable social scheme within the community
to promote the development of local social and human capital. We know that cultural habits do not
change quickly, and our research shows that organizations need to be proactive and seek very actively the participation of the local community if they want to see changes. Our case study highlights the fact that it
is important to invest actively in mobilization, local information and promotion and to do so with the
cooperation of local community organizations to attain some form of bonding with the local population,
have the positive effects expected in terms of involvement in the community and act as a lever for local
socio-economic development. </td>

as opportunities and supports for more inclusive and informed decision-making processes, i.e. as a tool, rather

The methodology is based on the case-study method,whose sources of evidence are: quantitative indicators, archival
documents, and excerpts from interviews with key stakeholders. In detail, the paper focuses on three
Southern Italian cities (Reggio Calabria, Catania and Palermo), which have been clustered for similar challenges
they have to face, in relation to their geographical proximity and cultural features. Findings show the two fold use
of technologies for cities: on the one hand, technology may be perceived as a panacea and Smart initiatives may
be isolated and episodic experiments; on the other, technologies may be critically incorporated in complex policies
and initiatives aimed at regenerating urban areas holistically, and Smart initiatives may be coordinated and
well-connected experiences. Authors argue that the second cases are feasible approaches for improving urban
planning in challenging South-European contexts. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The reconstruction of a damaged historic/modern urban system following a natural catastrophic event, even if
sophisticated, complex and expensive can become an opportunity to apply innovative methods of urban regeneration
oriented towards environmental sustainability. A research by the University of L'Aquila exploring the
consequences of the 2009 earthquake in central Italy, both in analytical and design terms, is focused on this
theme, applying innovative principles to the reconstruction project of the city of L'Aquila, capital of the Abruzzo
Region (Italy). The study carries out an analysis of the earthquake effects on urban systems and mobility and
proposes an operating strategy based on a multidisciplinary approach that integrates urban design and sustainable
mobility strategies. In particular, it outlines the components of Strategic Projects that has been developed
for the reconnection of the urban fragments created by the dispersion of the city after the earthquake,
which has applied the principles of multi-modal sustainable mobility.
The results of the study show that the post-quake reconstruction, if properly interpreted, can be a unique
opportunity to conceive and construct the conditions to implement a new and more efficient urban sustainable
transport model through advanced technologies based on outlining an innovative urban redesign approach. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In West European cities, culture has evolved to become a crucial ingredient of regeneration projects, in which
stakeholders' cooperation is of utmost importance and economic and social benefits are often well balanced. In
contrast, the majority of second-tier Central and East European cities, primarily non-holders of the European
Capital of Culture title, still seem to struggle with clearly defining the relationship between culture and urban
regeneration, precisely determining the responsibilities of the key actors and making the distinction between
social and economic goals in regeneration projects. In this paper, the authors join the emerging discussion on the
post-socialist context of culture-led regeneration through a case study of a street in the old core of Novi Sad,
Serbia. In an effort to contribute to understanding various challenges that Serbian cities have been facing since
the fall of communism, they seek to identify cultural effects of a very distinctive process of transition. They also
investigate the interplay between the citizens' cultural preferences, visions of urbanity, private sector's interests
and usage of urban space, and discuss the impacts of spontaneous utilization versus exploitation of space and
culture. Furthermore, they analyse the outcomes of culture-led transformation conducted in the absence of
cultural strategies and in-depth regeneration policies and marked by the laisser-faire attitude of the local authorities.
Having completed the analysis, the authors propose the means for redefining the relationship between
culture and regeneration in second-tier Serbian cities, yet also in other CEE cities of similar size, emphasizing the
role of culture, responsibilities of the local authorities, significance of bottom-up approaches and relevance of
place context. </td>

to the relative success of the conservation of these areas constituted preservation plans combined with
management tools adopted locally and practised with flexibility to allow for the changes necessary to
modern living. Even more important were the collaborative forms of governance developed over time
that managed to anchor the goals and norms of preservation in the population. </td>

process in China – A case study of Jinhuajie, Guangzhou </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A variety of stakeholders have proposed different models of urban regeneration of China, and indicate an institutional
arrangement that is more complex than a model dominated by the government or neoliberal interests.
This study argues that the path to an effective property-rights regime for urban regeneration has become circuitous
as it has needed to follow the trial-and-error process of institutional transition in China. Operational level
rights originally assigned to different actors have been gradually reclaimed by the land users and by the
effect of market forces through ‘property-rights regime in transition’. Four rounds of regeneration were observed
in Jinhuajie, Guangzhou over the past three decades, indicating the adoption of four property-rights regimes that
have evolved sequentially, namely, a semi-open market for neighbourhood redevelopment, a semi-open market
for land occupied by state-owned enterprises, an open market for redevelopment and an open market for both
redevelopment and refurbishment. Each property-rights regime only reassigns one or two bundles of operational-
level property rights from one actor to another to provide opportunities for older organisations to adapt to
the new system. This inevitably led to an interweaving urban fabric and sub-optimal results of urban regeneration.
This research suggests greater attention should be paid to cases of regeneration in different contexts
as well as the interactions among the various stakeholders. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article presents a hybrid model of managing and financing urban redevelopment and public infrastructure:
the Public Asset Corporation (PAC). The model has evolved through the example of Copenhagen City &amp; Port
Development Corporation (By og Havn, n.d.), a publicly owned privately managed institution that leverages
public assets through land value capture and Public-Private Partnerships. In addition, City &amp; Port leases and sells
land to private investors at market prices. The yield serves public benefit by funding a city-wide metro system.
Through a mandate by national law to always maximize the yield, City &amp; Port is sheltered from political interference.
Thus, it is the blend between public and private ownership, management, and financing that distinguishes
the PAC model as it evolved from the case study of City &amp; Port. In contrast, much literature on public
ownership and management focuses upon the operational inefficiencies, bureaucracy, and lack of accountability
of public organizations, while literature on private organizations is concerned with the amassment of profits
accrued by private investors, despite originating from profit generating public sector-driven initiatives, including
value appreciation arising from re-zoning, infrastructure, and other public investments. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The digital collection of historic aerial photography, held by the Department of Geography at the University of
Oviedo, has proved to be an important resource when analyzing the processes of urban development. Imagery
helps us identify the different pieces of urban fabric in their context, and furthermore, to understand how the
process of change unfolds. Photo interpretation techniques are used in order to detect the spatial pattern of the
new urban developments.
Gijón, in Spain, is a very good example of a Southern European city. Generally, these cities tend to be denser
than those in Northern Europe or even in North America. Even today the outskirts in South European cities are
not synonyms of low-density residential zones. The built-up area in Gijón has increased over the past decade; as a
result, several examples of new urban developments are available today, from densification and suburban infill
to urban regeneration policies. The new districts Nuevo Roces and Viesques are pointed out to explain the
relationship between urban form and social sustainability. Physical factors such as compact building forms,
cycling lanes, surrounding green areas and walkable neighborhoods are complemented by other aspects like
social housing, public transport connections and urban design with mixed land use in order to achieve sociallycompatible
urban areas.
To sum up, our proposal involves the use of historic aerial photography with the purpose of gaining effective
knowledge on new urban developments in Gijón. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Redevelopment activities on former bases include new housing developments, industrial,
training, educational and recreational facilities alongside retail and commercial quarters. This
paper elaborates on the American roots and the rationale of military base redevelopment as
one example of brownfield regeneration by adopting a comparative analysis using examples
from the United Kingdom, Germany and Jordan to highlight experiences, lessons learnt
and potential further study. In the UK, the policy to redevelop military land is driven by need
to reduce government spending, income generation and promoting government targets for
brownfield housing development. In the Jordanian case, the examination of available sources
indicates that although development on military sites has been promoted by a political commitment
to ‘sustainable’ urban regeneration, economic self-interest appears to triumph over
environmental and community concerns in the conversion process. This has generally been
developer driven. In sharp contrast to this, the case of Vauban in Germany clearly demonstrates
how community activism can play a central role in redeveloping a military site. The
paper goes on to argue that the challenge in military base redevelopment, like other brownfield
sites, will be to guarantee competitive advantages through revenue-generating activities
that can transform these sites into reliable economic opportunities while looking after the
interests of all the parties involved. </td>

antagonistic art practice in the city </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Martin Zebracki </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Coastal cities have increasingly welcomed initiatives for producing temporary urban art spaces to lure tourists
and revitalize the local economy. This article examines the under-explored contested relationships between a
major temporary art event and social (dis)engagement in the context of coastal urban regeneration. During the
pop-up art event Dismaland (2015), led by the reputed graffiti artist Banksy and company, the coastal resort of
Weston-super-Mare in England experienced an upsurge of international visitors. Banksy envisaged this
“Bemusement Park”, situated in an abandoned lido, as an antagonist twist of Disneyland and the commercial
modus operandus of theme parks. Drawing on discourse analysis of expert and public perspectives and autoethnographic
experience, this article challenges the experienced extent of antagonistic art practice in juxtaposition
to the formal discourse of creators and urban policymakers. The examination of the event's artistic, behavioral,
spatial and temporal frameworks shows how it ambiguously navigated between authentic and engineered
trajectories of involving its target audiences. The creators' anarchist plea for radical change was
ambivalently met with appreciation of an urban art space for serious contemplation as well as a perceived lack of
local community investment – the latter rendering Dismaland an urban ‘art colony’ that fostered an elitist global
art market rather than urban-citizen-led participation. The in-depth case study concludes that greater attention,
both in urban policy and scholarship, is needed to the implications of the production of temporary urban art
spaces for immediate inclusive engagement with end users as well as sustained community development. The
study particularly calls for caution in assuming inclusive community benefits of art-led regeneration as abundantly
ascribed in creative city theories and urban policies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Living conditions in informal areas present a severe problemto the development of society, particularly to public
health and the respective socioeconomic context. People in these areas have no viable alternative to solve this
problem themselves. In this study, several successful approaches are surveyed and new methods are developed
to design a holistic process capable of not only tackling the issue of informal settlements, but doing so in a way
that is cognizant of the current global economic reality and that integrates all the dimensions of sustainable development.
In this study, an integrated regeneration strategy for Luanda's metropolitan plan in Angola is developed.
The methodology is supported by a social context analysis and highly participative design process. The
informal settlements vary in type and structure, urban patterns, and their social and economic structure. These
factors have been taken into consideration in the approach advanced in this study, as they are deemed key aspects
for the fine-tuning of the final approach. Hence, a partnership model is presented, where the public sector
provides development conditions for the private sector. The model is supported by regeneration mechanisms
that establish the roles and procedures of each stakeholder within the process. Multiple criteria for rehousing
as well as guidelines for social and affordable housing are used to create an integrated approach. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> After the discovery of the Witwatersrand gold reef in 1886, the city of Johannesburg became,
within a very short period of time, the financial and commercial hub of sub-Saharan Africa.
It maintained this position throughout the earlier half of the twentieth century in the face of
increasing opposition to the apartheid political system. By the late 1980s, however, this had
changed. The restructuring of the global economy and increasing political pressure had resulted
in a city whose economic base was declining and in which the social and economic exclusion
upon which it had been built was no longer sustainable. This resulted in successive attempts
by the urban authorities to reinvent a city which could claim a position in the mainstream
global economy and become a city all its citizens could feel part of. This paper sketches these
attempts, locates them in certain traditions of urban regeneration and exposes their theoretical
and practical inadequacies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> While the historical cores of the post-socialist cities of Central and Eastern Europe are adapting to the invasion
of tourism and profitable companies, dynamic regeneration is altering the character of the inner-city
neighbourhoods from working class peripheries to modern multi-functional urban sub-centres. Changing
residential environments, landscapes and functions affect the daily lives and residential satisfaction of the
local population, and especially of the low-income and elderly people facing mobility restrictions. This
research evaluates the residential satisfaction of the elderly in two Prague city centre neighbourhoods that
experienced dramatic changes in their residential environment during the post-socialist transition: the
historical core, which has been exposed to massive touristification and commercialization, and a former
working class neighbourhood that has been experiencing rapid regeneration. The local accessibility of services,
public spaces, housing and social support was examined through a questionnaire survey. Contrary to
our expectations based on the existing literature review, the results show that, despite the rapid revitalization
processes, the elderly are fairly satisfied with their residential environment in both neighbourhood
types. </td>

is critical. This paper focuses on the applicability of such concepts to the emergency planning
response demonstrated within the City of Manchester immediately following the bombing of
its commercial core in June 1996. Following a brief consideration of the relationship between
disasters and emergency planning procedures, the paper focuses on the impact of the bomb

to the temporal and spatial arrangements put in place both for handling the emergency and
for the subsequent process of recovery. Finally, it evaluates the main lessons to be learnt from

decision-making processes and the extent to which provincial former industrial cities in the
UK have overcome past images. These cities are amongst the most active in pursuing the
meetings industry through their urban regeneration strategies. The survey evidence strongly
suggests that the selected towns and cities had been successful in transforming their externally
perceived images, although towns and cities with weak images in the past still tend to have
weak images, whereas cities with strong industrial images in the past, which have undergone
extensive regeneration, have strong, rejuvenated images. Additionally, image is important in
the location decision-making processes of meetings organisers, though not as important as other
factors. This paper demonstrates that a more nuanced understanding of the relationship

It is a vibrant, dynamic and rapidly-transforming Balkan metropolis that has received very little
academic attention to date. This is despite the city’s turbulent history, which has seen its complete
destruction and rebirth over the course of several millennia. Current developments in Skopje reflect
the consequences of the post-communist transition underway since the early 1990s, as well as the legacies
embedded in the decision-making behaviours and physical structures lingering from the city’s rich
past. They have led to the internal differentiation of the urban fabric under the influence of processes of
reurbanisation, densification, infill, upgrading and suburbanisation. But the city still lacks a coherent
planning and policy framework to deal with these changes, partly as a result of the inadequacies of its
idiosyncratic administrative organisation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cities around the world are under pressure from population growth, frenetic global economic restructuring,
and climatic perturbations. Some, like London, attract an excess of speculative, momentum or
tax-informed inward investment to finance their intensification. Provincial towns, on the other hand,
which sustain extractive metropolii, can wither without capital or talent. Sensible planning and calibrated
regional investment is the antidote to polarisation but confronts an apparent ‘smart’ or ‘sustainable’
conundrum. Grandiose, technical megaprojects like Songdo or Masdar cities and sprawling,
disconnected estates are an anathema. We articulate a putative smart and sustainable solution
(‘smart-SUR’) with ‘institutional’, ‘project’ and innovative ‘funding’ components and explore
mega-urban regeneration projects in the UK and Holland. Smart-SUR has geographical, procedural and
teleological aspects. Its mechanism involves local engagement, institutional strengthening, tight project
screening and innovative regenerative funding. Its outcome are inclusive, measured, and coordinated
transformations which ‘sweat’ existing assets, counter the long-tail of educational failure, and catalyse
productive local innovation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Responding to the international trend of urban population decline, a sustainable urban form has been pursued
around the world, with the compact city movement a typical example. However, compact city debate has often
been criticized for its inclination to bio-physical environmental and economic goals and a lack of treatment of
empirical social aspects like residential behavior. The present study was thus aimed at examining the gap between
Japanese compact city policy and actual spatial patterns of population turnover, inheritance and migration.
The case study was of residential areas of a Japanese regional city, Utsunomiya. The study used a fourstep
procedure: a) identifying the distributions of inheritors and migrators; b) constructing a detailed database of
five characteristics of the residential areas, i.e., age of development, orderliness, road width, transport access,
and social cohesion; c) identifying relationships between the number of inheritors and migrators and residential
characteristics using a Poisson regression model; d) comparing the compact city plan underway with established
patterns of population turnover. The results show that the number of inheritors has positive relationships with
age of the residential area and access to rail transport and downtown. The migrators tend to have a random
distribution in comparison with inheritors. These empirical residential patterns appear irrelevant to the government's
bus-oriented compact city policy, so the government should reconsider approaches to realize an acceptable
sustainable urban form. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Drawing upon the game-theoretical concepts for urban land redevelopment in China, this paper provides further
substantiation on, and demonstrates, two major fronts in empirical terms. First, the redevelopment trajectory of
industrial land that had been used by a central state-owned enterprise (SOE) was identified and was shown as
deadlocked by disputes on the pathway to cooperation between the local government and the original land user.
Second, the shifts in the bargains between the pair from the “prisoners’ dilemma” to “pigs’ payoffs,” and then to
“neo-pigs’ payoffs” were analyzed, and we showed how industrial land can be redeveloped. Finally, we argued
that disputes between the entrepreneuralization of local governments and the politicization of SOEs constitute a
potent system of explanatory coordinates that effectively reveal the hidden logic of industrial land redevelopment
in urban China. Different from the redevelopment of local SOEs, communications between the user and
owner of urban land, as well as the tradeoff of benefits, are key factors in breaking the aforementioned deadlock. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A focus on the ‘mega’ aspect of hallmark events can divert attention from the micro – those local communities
who are most impacted by the event. Similarly, attention to the ‘event’ aspect underplays the long process of
bidding and preparation before any putative legacy of urban transformation for local people. This paper uses
qualitative data to unpack the complex and multi-layered views of local residents, living in a deprived
neighbourhood beside the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games site in Scotland. They reflect on five years of
intensive urban regeneration, evaluate the experience of ‘lockdown’ at Games time, and consider their hopes
and fears for the future of the community. Interviewing a mixture of lifelong, established, new and returning
residents, we found considerable common ground across the different groups in terms of hopes for a new,
mixed community in the area. However, findings also highlight concerns around urban governance practices
and the limitations of a market-led approach to regeneration. </td>

historically suffered from its proximity to the Tyneside conurbation centred around Newcastle-upon-
Tyne, Sunderland has a long and illustrious history and the city is an interesting one to examine in a City
Profile in its own right. In the first instance the legacy of the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation
regeneration initiatives from the late 80s and early 90s has been the piecemeal development of unrelated

2002 by a local partnership to regenerate the city, has had a much broader focus and remit with a clear
mandate for redevelopment. This profile examines recent regeneration initiatives and a move from a
piecemeal development of disparate sites to partnership working and a more holistic view of regeneration
activities, and is a good example of some of the innovative ways in which smaller cities are seeking to
re-image and regenerate in response to economic crises. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2020 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In the increasingly tight race of inter-urban competition, the idea that cities have to be made creative has gripped
the imagination of urban planners and scholars alike. This process is imagined as straightforward, readily exportable
and devoid of conflict. The paper uses the perspective of relational place-making to reveal the creative
city imperative as a political process. This is carried out through the medium of conflict, which brings about two
contrasting place frames, which progressively reveal each other's political connections. We use the case of a
former central-European prison, located in Brno, the Czech Republic, to show how making a city creative is just
one possible framing of a place, how making cities attractive to creative individuals engenders resistance and
how historical memory summons the powerful genius loci, that is nevertheless relational and contingent. The
results illustrate in detail how the conflict between development and preservation unfolds around six axes of
opposition that define the two frames (e.g. future vs. past, part vs. whole etc.) and how these axes are themselves
linked to various concepts of place and time. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Temporary uses represent innovative and experimental solutions to give new life to disused facilities and spaces
while conserving their historical, identity and environmental value. By offering the opportunity to assign new
functions and meanings to abandoned places and create economic and social development, these practices can
play a strategic role in promoting an integrated approach as a starting point for urban regeneration processes.
Based on these assumptions, this paper aims to investigate how temporary uses of disused urban spaces can
interact in a practical sense with formal planning systems and urban policies. To do so, it analyses a European
project implemented in Rome aimed at fostering temporary activities in public space and reactivating several
disused areas by directly involving the local community. The paper proposes a few observations touching on two
issues: firstly, whether the temporary use of disused space can be a practical opportunity to not only re-design
urban space but also establish a new governance model. Secondly, whether such practices can effectively address
the needs and aspirations of citizens, as a precondition for improving quality of life in the city. </td>

state policy of disaster prevention in Turkey </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In Turkey, urban regeneration mirrors a shift towards neoliberal urban policies based on economic strategymaking.
The measures in the name of “regeneration for liveable cities” are rapidly transforming the appearance
of inner-city areas with great revenue-generating potential. The boundaries of legitimization are described
in areas where the process of depression is visible and the social acceptability of the residential population
decreases, and at present are under the risk of disasters,mostly in squatter housing areas and dilapidated historical
centers. Legal regulations have been reformulating this system since the 1980s so that applications can be
supported effortlessly and facilitated through government assistance.
This study discusses the final legal regulation, namely Law No. 6306, which is the Law on the Regeneration of
Areas Under the Risk of Disasters. The study leans on the hypothesis that: This law has opened a new gateway
for a fast and organized system of urban regeneration. Urban regeneration has gained a new momentum with
the inclusion of risk identification in a country under the risk of earthquakes. The study methodology begins
with a literature review concerning urban regeneration, development of urban regeneration in Turkey, and
disaster risk. Second, legal regulations in favor of urban regeneration and Cabinet decisions on risk areas in
Turkey are critically examined. Finally, areas that are designated to be under the risk of disasters in Ankara
are analyzed based on earthquake risk identification, urban development, and urban policy strategies in favor
of regeneration.
The findings of the study substantiate the hypothesis. Regeneration is now increasing the resilience of societies
to natural disasters. However, the development of the criteria of disaster risk as a reason for regeneration is
not mature enough to be a part of a mitigation strategy and an integrated planning approach. While all risk
areas are in deprived or squatter housing areas, risk assessment is not so difficult in terms of physical vulnerability.
Economic and social vulnerabilities are out of the scope, and there is no regeneration perspective. Thus, the interventions
that are performed with this law produce the same results, that is, a single recipe of regeneration which
is poorly integrated into a planned urban development strategy. Gentrification is still the unpronounced, yet
expected, result. </td>

and their views on collaborative partnerships were explored. Qualitative data were gathered via
semi-structured interviews from 19 purposively selected stakeholders. This case study determined public–
private cooperation in regenerating Gwangju could, simultaneously, generate positive socio-cultural
and economic impacts in society. However, stakeholders lacked opportunities for active participation.
Hence, closer working relationships between central–municipal government and public–private/voluntary
sectors were recommended. The case confirmed that long-term implementation of such projects
needs to be anticipated and based on longitudinal and structured strategic planning to promote successful
partnership collaborations amongst central/municipal governments, local communities and residents.

neighborhood organizations in partnershipwith the City and Regional Planning (CRP) Department at the University
of Memphis – called the Vance Avenue Collaborative (VAC) – in the CN Planning Initiative. Launched in 2011
with significant community support, the CN Planning Initiative ended in 2013 with a resident-led oppositional
planning effort that challenged the institutional plan.
The VAC story explores some of the pitfalls that might arise in institutionally-created spaces for citizen participation,
by revealing the broad range of tactics used by public officials to marginalize democratic citizen participation.
Based on the issues that emerged during the CN Planning Initiative, the VAC created alternative strategies
to respond to those generated through institutional planning. These counter-strategies, framed in Advocacy
Planning and Action Research approaches were able to secure some important achievements along the way
and might be useful for communities within publicly sponsored urban revitalization efforts. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper reviews transport's historical, contemporary and future role in shaping urban development since
industrialisation. Previous definitions of Transit Oriented Development (TOD) starting in the late 20th century
are challenged. Three distinct eras of TOD are identified: from the mid-19th century to early 20th century;
Planned TOD in the mid-20th century; and TOD for urban regeneration and/or urban expansion since the late
20th century, now featuring rail and bus rapid transit, cycling and walking, shared use mobility, and automated
transport. Future links with disruptive transport technologies are highlighted as themes that must be examined
for assisting TOD's further development. The authors make the case, using empirical evidence from selected TOD
applications from around the world, that high frequency transit service is essential for successful contemporary
and future planned TODs. TOD is then redefined for the 21st century and best practice policy recommendations
are made. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The purpose of this paper is to take part in the debate about power relationships in contemporary cities between
the agents of urban renewal and the local communities, as mediated by cultural and artistic interventions and
projects. Our study proposes a new conceptual frame, focused on the comparison between two notions of heterotopia
as theoretical alternatives for the interpretation of cities as social and participatory spaces. The notions
we consider may be traced to two key thinkers such as Michel Foucault and Henri Lefebvre, and lay the foundation
for alternative analytical paradigms of the contemporary urban condition, in relation to artistic and
cultural practices in the public space. We draw upon these two alternative readings of heterotopia to explore the
implications of the interaction of artistic practices with the urban space as a contested terrain from the viewpoint
of power relationships. In our analysis, we find that Foucault's notion of heterotopia is potentially conducive to
top-down planning processes and to gentrification. Lefebvre's notion is instead possibly more suited to participatory
practices as strategies of reactivation of the right to the city. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Governments and planners in the Global North are increasingly faced with the challenge of providing services for
growing numbers of families in the inner city. Rather than quitting the city, couples are staying to raise children in
gentrified, working class housing or in new medium and high density developments built pursuant to policies of
urban consolidation and renewal. Difficulties have arisen when parents discover that inner city schools do not
meet their expectations either in terms of quality or quantity. Problems with quantity are a consequence of government
failing to anticipate the presence of families in new high density developments, particularly marked in
Australia where apartments have never been considered appropriate housing for families. This article explores
the actual and projected presence of children in inner Sydney and the pressure this has placed on school places.
The government's ability to anticipate school demand is complicated by neoliberal education policies of
rationalisation and ‘school choice’, which have reduced the number of inner city schools and created unpredictable
movement of families between schools. Parent lobby groups have now forced the government to plan new
schools, which is proving a complicated and expensive exercise in the high density, high value urban core. The
conclusion of the research is that inner urban redevelopment must include sufficient public space and infrastructure
not only for schools in the immediate future, but also for adaptive reuse for other, perhaps equally unanticipated,
needs in the longer-term. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Turkish governments have discovered the potential in regenerating inner-city squatter housing areas, in
order to increase the competitiveness of cities in the global context. Urban regeneration is defined as a
spatial strategy in which prestigious urban uses have been increasing through private sector investments
in public areas. These developments have opened new discussions on the displacement of lower income
groups and gentrification of central areas in a developing country. The aim of this study is to suggest that
in Turkey, urban regeneration is a primary tool in the restructuring of cities and that it is devised as a
government-assisted urban spatial strategy to achieve gentrification. This study examines the case of
Ankara, Turkey, and indicates that the increased rent from the city’s central areas can be experienced
quickly. Field study showed that the physical structure and environmental conditions have changed,
the squatter population has been displaced from the area, and the higher income group has taken the area
over. With this transformation, the area has been re-structured according to the expectations of the local
authority and the increased rent has been facilitated. These data strengthen the idea that gentrification is
effective in the regeneration process. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Compared with the considerable number of studies on urban redevelopment highlighting the downside
of wholesale redevelopment in breaking up communities, only limited reports exist on successful prevention
of demolition of lived spaces in place-specific communities with strong social capital. Massive redevelopment
and restructuring of the urban fabric have occurred in post-open door China. Top-down urban
regeneration policies in Chinese historic cities are characterized by a bipolar approach: conservation of
limited listed heritage buildings and massive redevelopment of traditional quarters. This paper examines
an extraordinary story of a community in the Drum Tower Muslim District in Xi’an that counteracted the
implementation of a district redevelopment plan. This study also explores how the strong religious and
ethnic social capital of the Muslim residents helped them sustain the fight for their right to the place.
Their fight eventually forced the district government to incorporate the retention of their ways of living
and business in the revised redevelopment plan. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2000 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Despite the emergence of urban regeneration and sustainable development as parallel strands
of British urban policy, there has been little coordination between them and an imbalance
in action with greater emphasis given to achieving urban regeneration, especially economic
regeneration, than to sustainability. It can be argued that all urban regeneration contributes
to sustainable development through the recycling of derelict land and buildings, reducing
demand for peripheral development and facilitating the development of more compact cities.
But below this strategic level British urban policy has yet to fully address the requirement for
more sustainable development. This paper addresses this question through an examination of
policy in Liverpool and a case study of Duke Street/Bold Street (the Rope Walks Partnership):
a mixed use area adjoining the city centre. It is important to place local action within the
context of national policies and so the paper begins with some discussion of the extent to which
the principles of sustainable development are included within national urban regeneration policies
before going on to examine policy at the metropolitan scale in Liverpool and then at the
more detailed level of the Rope Walks area. The conclusions suggest that it is economic regeneration
and more precisely property redevelopment, that is the main driving force regenerating
the area and that there is some way to go before the city or the case study area achieve an
environmentally sustainable regeneration process. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper aims to rethink creative city theory by analyzing urban regeneration processes in Japan
through cultural creativity and social inclusion. The impact of Florida’s theory has led to the common
misperception that cities prosper as people of the creative class, such as artists and gays, gather. However,
attracting people of the creative class does not automatically make a creative city. Empirical analyses of
Kanazawa City, clarify that the creative city needs a ‘culture-based production system’, a well-balanced
system of cultural production and cultural consumption that takes advantage of accumulated cultural
capital. This paper also examines Osaka City, where creative city policies failed to produce adequate
results because they did not take root as a comprehensive urban strategy. However, in spite of these failures,
a lively and inclusive grassroots movement has emerged around the creative city. This movement
brings Osaka towards being a socially-inclusive creative city. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2009 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In the last few decades, changes in consumer habits have been observed in household economies. These
habits now focus on large retail chains and shopping centers out-of-town rather than independent retailers
sited, for the most part, in shopping districts or in the town center. One factor in this trend is the retailer’s
accessibility to the customer. Because of this relationship, the retail market share is affected by the development
of an efficient transport system, such as the Metro. This paper examines both short and long-term
positive and negative interactions between the retail sector and the introduction of the Metro using empirical
evidence from three middle-sized Spanish cities (Bilbao, Málaga and Seville). It also analyzes how
retailers assess the influence of a nearby Metro station on their business. Finally, the conclusion is drawn
that a new planning model for urban transportation infrastructure works is beginning to prevail with the
backing of smallbusiness association lobbies. This model seeks to minimize the effect of works-related negative
externalities on urban retail fabrics but can never guarantee a happy ending for independent stores. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Vacant urban areas (VUAs) can consist of both vacant land and abandoned structures. In this article, the authors
summarize a recent survey on VUA, examine current conditions and causes of VUA, and explore the possible
interconnections among these conditions and causes. The research examines employment, fiscal position, elasticity,
population alteration, and regional location as primary variables. We find that VUAs are not interchangeable
indicators of urban decay. Vacant land is most often associated with cities that have expanded their
political boundaries while structural abandonment is more related to a city's population loss. Improvement of the
local economy may not necessarily help reduce vacant land while structural abandonment is more sensitive to a
city's economic status. Regional planning for VUAs, the strategic location of new industries and jobs, and new
population/density regulatory approaches could be the next phase in addressing VUA changes. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> With more than 1.6 million inhabitants in the city proper and another 2.2 million in the immediate surrounding
area Vienna, the capital of the Republic of Austria, is one of the largest cities in Europe. If the
city is evaluated by its historical significance, cultural heritage or the quality of life it falls in the top
rank. It is the specific image of Vienna which allows it to be seen as more important than may be suggested
by its place in the global rankings of cities. However, globalization has changed the urban fabric
of the city dramatically within the last decade, confronting urban planners with tensions between the
demands of the global economies and the necessity of coping with the historic structures that have
evolved in course of the city’s rise to become a European metropolis in the 19th century. Still, the legacy
of social cohesion in Vienna is being eroded by the restructuring of urban society due to the global economies.
Social cohesion, urban regeneration and the challenges of the global competition of cities have
recently been the prime agendas of urban planning in Vienna. In this competition the cultural heritage
of the city’s glorious past reveals itself as a prominent competitive advantage in ‘theming’ and marketing
post-modern Vienna. </td>

cities over the last two decades, a broad section of literature suggests the need for questioning the
impacts of urban regeneration projects as an integral part of neo-liberal policies. In the context of Turkey,
by focusing on Istanbul, this article aims to investigate the success of the regeneration initiatives in
achieving sustainable communities in deprived historic housing neighbourhoods. After defining the
interplay between sustainable community, community need and urban conservation, this research
examines the recent regeneration experience of Fener and Balat (F&amp;B) -a poor and declining neighbourhood
in the historic peninsula of Istanbul-, and discusses the merits and shortcomings, challenges
and conflicts of the European Union (EU)-funded regeneration endeavour in developing a sustainable
community in F&amp;B, while conserving the urban fabric. Debating on the research findings, the article seeks
to underline the crucial issues in creating sustainable communities in the historic housing sites of
Istanbul and Turkey. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Urban regeneration has emerged as a response to the process of decay in historic districts. Based on a
detailed literature review and the distinctive features of this mode of project practice in China, the
current paper examines critical success factors (CSFs) in historic district regeneration projects. These
factors are grouped into six main dimensions, namely, external environment, project characteristics,
participants, project implementation, organization governance and the conservation of historic and
cultural values. The internal relations among the identified CSFs are developed with the Interpretive
Structural Modeling (ISM) Method. This is followed by a case study showing the use of these results.
Project K (a renovation project) and Project J (a redevelopment project) are selected to explore and
compare their critical success paths (CSPs) with the optimized Critical Path Method (CPM), drawing on
project management methods. The results show that Project K relies on the strength of the real estate
market to achieve development of cultural industries with cultural characteristics, while Project J creates
a strong cultural atmosphere to attract tourists and then increases cultural propaganda efforts, with an
operating income used to achieve cultural continuity. Both cultural operation modes can achieve the
cultural objectives of the project with a different CSP. The identification of CSFs, their internal relations,
and the CSPs are explored in two cases, which provide useful guidance to project parties planning to
participate in dynamic management of historic district regeneration. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2014 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Industrial heritage conservation advocates cultural, historical and economic significance of obsolete
spaces and transforms them into viable places. Thus, it is often adopted in urban regeneration projects,
which seek historic, esthetic and economic elevation of degenerated areas. Its policy domain has become
multi-disciplinary. In this respect, to enrich a multi-disciplinary dialogue on conservation, this paper
examines how a cultural policy project in Incheon, Korea, has dealt with industrial heritage. Specifically,
it examines first, the processes through old spaces were rediscovered and institutionalized as heritage
sites. Second, it investigates how the project has endeavored to keep balance between achieving cultural
valorization and economic viability of obsolete spaces. The paper emphasizes that industrial heritage
conservation involves not only adaptive re-use but also the creation of cultural values of obsolete spaces.
The latter, especially, is a prerequisite to establishing and retaining heritage values and sites. If cultural
initiatives that aim to create cultural values are operated as a tool for redevelopment and financial
revenue-making, they might not play their best role in conservation. The paper concludes that conceptual
consistency and shared values should guide public participation and conservation objectives and
methods. </td>

contributes to an increase in wellbeing and enhances the attractiveness of open spaces in

renewal, upgrading and urban revitalization as primarily market-driven endeavours targeting middle
class and higher income groups sometimes at the expense of less privileged residents. This paper reflects
on the current debate of the social effects of greening using selected examples. We discuss what tradeoffs
between social and ecological developments in cities mean for the future debate on greening cities
and a socially balanced and inclusive way of developing our cities for various groups of urban dwellers.
We conclude that current and future functions and features of greening cities have to be discussed more

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2012 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> It is well acknowledged that low carbon emissions is one of the key factors contributing to sustainable
urban development and effectively tackling climate change. Adaptive reuse of buildings is a form of
sustainable urban regeneration, as it extends the building’s life and avoids demolition waste, encourages
reuses of the embodied energy and also provides significant social and economic benefits to the society.
Thus, it embraces the different dimensions of sustainability. However, the debates over which sustainability
factors are key, and how to address them all in practice, remain unresolved. This study begins with
an intensive literature review of the factors that contribute to the goal of sustainable development in the
conservation of built heritage. This is followed by in-depth interviews with practitioners who have
participated in adaptive reuse projects in Hong Kong. These interviews confirm the reliability of the
shortlisted sustainability factors. More importantly, this paper examines the challenges in incorporating
a sustainability framework into adaptive reuse projects. The authors stress that the framework for
achieving sustainable, low carbon adaptive reuse should be viewed more holistically, integrating social,
economic, environmental, urban and political policies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2002 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper raises a number of important issues relating to legal and economic development concepts. It
concentrates on the supply constraints affecting land development decisions of both private and public
landowners in releasing land for development purposes. With reference to the indigenous land rights in
Kuala Lumpur, this paper focuses on the restrictions in interest, which may limit the land from being
transferred in the open market. With a limited market, the indigenous land achieves a lower value in the
market place because transactions are limited within a particular group of people only. As a result, the
market forces are restricted and the land development process for urban regeneration often comes to a halt.
In examining the role of the indigenous land market in the redevelopment process of Kuala Lumpur, the
study uses an institutional analysis to show the way in which these restrictions in interest affect landowners’
decisions and, thus, restrict the supply of land to real estate redevelopment. In conclusion, the paper shows
various causes for land supply constraints and ways to improve these with the aim to undertake urban
redevelopment initiatives considering pressure for more land in the market. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2015 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The impacts of climate change and decreasing local resources are increasingly threatening the resilience
and sustainable management of urban areas and infrastructures worldwide. To cope with such threads
and vulnerabilities, urban sustainability and resilience oriented plans have been developed. Accordingly,
policy makers need to learn how to properly integrate urban sustainability with urban resilience principles
and practices in the re-shaping of urban agendas. In order to highlight the future potential of
integrating transformative resilience principles into the general sustainability approach, this paper
provides a critical review of a recent and successful urban regeneration and development plan, the
“Mexico City Green Plan”. This paper also discusses a feasibility study for urban redevelopment and
transition towards resilience in Mexico City, in order to illustrate the necessity and potential of urban
resilience for the improvement of the life prospects of disadvantaged inhabitant groups. The Valle del
Chalco neighborhood in Mexico City is presented as an example, whereby resilient and sustainable urban
transformation was achieved through an integrated and sustainable decentralized water management
and infrastructure plan. In practice, the terms ‘Sustainability’ and ‘Resilience’ can be exploited to justify
conventional, non-sustainable urban development practices. The results discussed in this paper
demonstrate the necessity of the integration of transformative resilience principles within sustainable
urban redevelopment and regeneration. The main findings are i) Policy makers underestimate the potential
of urban resilience in shaping more sustainable urban futures, since they only understand
resilience as the flipside of specific vulnerabilities, ii) The building of urban resilience within sustainable
urban transitions and redevelopment can effectively foster people empowerment, particularly in combination
with the decentralization of resources management systems, and iii) The main challenge for the
implementation and execution of transitions processes towards urban resilience and sustainability is the
elimination of political barriers. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2015 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Urban regeneration in Western countries can count on a long-lasting tradition of experiences in which
civil society has played a fundamental role in counterbalancing the system of power, resulting in profound
urban governance readjustments. This has been the result of the increasing centrality of horizontal
alliances between citizens and associations involved in urban affairs since the late 1960s in the West.
Similar theoretical frameworks have been applied in China. However, these have frequently resulted in
conceptual shortcuts that depict civil society as immature or lacking and the state as authoritarian. This
paper will explore whether these categories are still entirely valid to urban regeneration in China. While
the regime has traditionally prevented horizontal linkages of associations in urban governance (supporting
their vertical integration to ensure a certain degree of soft control), there are signs of change. In
particular, three cases of urban regeneration in historic areas will be used to discuss the changing role
played by civil society in China. The ultimate goal is to examine whether horizontal linkages across
groups of heterogeneous citizens are arising at the micro-level of urban governance. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper aims at scrutinizing the influence of knowledge utilization on the actors' interplay and self-organized
localized regeneration of an urban village in China, thereby developing alternatives to simple demolition and
redevelopment approaches. In particular, it investigates a bottom-up place-making initiative for the upgrading of
Xiasha village in Shenzhen. The case study shows how an urban village may take advantage of its favorable
location factors by gradually and relatively carefully upgrading its built environment and developing its assets as
profitably as possible at the same time. Despite its crucial role in understanding the regeneration of urban
villages, the knowledge dimension is still absent from the respective debates in China. In the case of Xiasha,
local, institutional and technical knowledge of stakeholders’ rationalities, behavior and interpretations were
utilized simultaneously and strategically. Technical knowledge contributed to the idea of a spacious central
square; institutional knowledge enabled its implementation; and local knowledge allowed to give symbolic
meaning and local identity to the place by making strong use of traditions, historic memories and cultural values
when designing the layout and the furniture of the square and its surroundings. Traditional local culture and
festivals even experienced a renaissance. With an increasing awareness of the importance of urban villages as
living space, more careful and gradual approaches towards upgrading urban villages are needed notwithstanding
the low quality and serious urban problems that are very often found in them. The case study shows that the way
knowledge is used may serve as a role model for urban village regeneration during high-speed urbanization in
China, instead of resorting to simplistic developer-led, socially exclusive models of renewal. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper explores the relationship between urban regeneration and sustainability within the postapartheid
city of Durban, South Africa, using mega-projects as a lens. In the past 20 years Durban has
been shaped by both globalisation and post-apartheid restructuring, through processes of pro-growth
urban regeneration and social transformation. Simultaneously, sustainability has emerged as a critical
concept in the development and management of the city. This paper examines the regeneration landscape
of the city, focussing on the implementation of two “new” mega-projects, as a regeneration
strategy. These are the Moses Mabhida Stadium and the Point Waterfront Development. Furthermore it
reflects upon the inclusion of sustainable city principles within the development of these projects, in
order to determine the extent to which this urban regeneration strategy considers sustainability. The
paper concludes that the two agendas of urban regeneration and sustainability are currently divergent
rather than convergent, and suggests that they require further integration to ensure a more sustainable
urban future. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Rural to urban migrants are the dominant component of population growth in China’s coastal cities. China’s
unique household registration system has excluded migrants from most public housing, resulting in pronounced housing segregation – a social phenomenon that has come to be China’s greatest urban social planning challenge. In this paper, we analyze the determinants of migrant housing choices and migrant housing needs following the conventional utility-based approach, but we also emphasize the important role of social capital in migrant decision-making. A case study of Shenzhen shows that quantifiable measures of physical, locational, land use and economic attributes cannot fully explain the congregation of migrants in informal communities and that social capital plays an important role in their housing choices. Social networks, social norms, and trust among neighbors are key factors in the establishment of migrant communities. This study reveals a new aspect of migrant housing needs that will be useful to planners, by paying greater heed to social capital in urban regeneration
and migrant housing provision. A more inclusive and humanistic approach to the housing of migrants is
suggested. </td>

is museumized in the contemporary Shanghai landscape. The focus on urban regeneration efforts has seen the renovation of Shikumen Houses in Xintiandi, which demonstrates how contemporary spaces are
imagined in ways that conjure up ‘‘Old Shanghai’’. Through this process of creating trans-historical spaces, the original place meanings of Xintiandi are re-cast by its present stakeholders. By deploying iconography
as a particular device of place promotion, the paper illuminates the fragments of history that have been fore
grounded and muted by these strategies. Xintiandi is broadly conceived as a site of consumption that is
reflective of emerging new spaces of consumption in Shanghai; as spaces that are set within the context of
unequal power relations in urban planning and heritage conservation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> What is the function and future prospect for older and more historic neighborhoods in an atypical
Islamic city? This study case from Amman, Jordan, identifies three main factors that have circumscribed the neighborhood’s urban development: changes to landuse, rent-control bylaws, and processes of land
succession. A survey of the ownership registry for 666 plots for the period 1946–2002 reveals that
inheritance plays an important role in the processes of land succession. Such processes, based as they are on
Islamic thinking about inheritance, are expected to be the most persistent factor affecting the future form
and function of the neighborhood. The effect of such processes of land succession may be compared to the
function observed elsewhere for waqf property in terms of contributing to the sustainability of traditional
crafts and trades in old bazaars; in the case presented here, however, processes of land succession, are
contributing to the creation of opportunities for development and redevelopment by freeing a sizeable
percentage of available land, built or unbuilt, with the passing of every generation. Thus, in contrast to the
often cited adverse effect such processes have in rural areas when leading to the fragmentation of
agricultural farming areas, the same processes are here found to be conducive to urban regeneration and
redevelopment. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Urban regeneration is a complicated process as it involves a lot of parties each with different interests
and agendas. Regeneration of urban villages is an even more intricate issue in China due to the dual
systems of property rights over urban and rural land. While a lot of attention has been given to the
governance structure applied to the regeneration process, this paper tries to analyze the changing
ideological foundation for local authorities in China to execute such regeneration in a more efficient and
less costly way. By a detailed case study of Liede Village in Guangzhou, we find that local authorities in
China are willing to explore neoliberal approach in coordinating with market forces in the process of
regeneration. The results in this case study are promising as all parties involved got what they wanted
from the regeneration scheme. However, one should not be mistaken that this is a paradigm shift in the
governance ideology. We expect that such progress to take place only in a gradual manner when circumstances
in the market and socio-political environments allow it to proceed further, a situation not
dissimilar with how ships advance gradually in a canal via various locks. We coin this situation in this
paper a “locks analogy”. </td>

to the multi-actor governance structure. With a theoretical underpinning of the concept “regime
building”, this paper examines how urban coalitions are being forged or dismantled in the process of
redevelopment of urban villages in China. More importantly, this paper aims at illustrating how different
forms of power relations eventually assist, deter and impact on the outcome of urban regeneration in this
ruraleurban transition in China. From examining the two cases (one more satisfactory than the other) in
Shenzhen, we find that local authority in China plays a much more influential role than their counter-parts
in the West. In addition, urban coalitions tend be more formal than that depicted by the Urban Regime
theory. The more satisfactory case in this paper illustrates that the local authority which is diplomatic in
their negotiation and shows commitment to support the private sector in the process of regeneration,
especially in terms of resources and planning policy, tends to build more sustainable coalition that works,
and vice versa. </td>

and functions. Regeneration effort was a major approach considered as a suitable tool to overcome
burdens of the communist urbanistic model, which was typical of high population density, extent public
spaces, and resulting in a weak interlink between urban design and the needs of local communities. In
this paper, we use the best practice approach and analyse 56 urban regeneration projects carried our
between 1989 and 2011 in 12 of the CEECs in order to identify the key issues addressed by regeneration
effort and to evaluate the success with which the regeneration projects involved local communities. In
addition, the case study based on a questionnaire survey (Ne st emice, Northern Czechia) is presented,
illustrating the level of public participation within the regeneration project and perception of project
results by the local community. Our results suggest that although there exist important territorial differences
among the CEECs, the involvement of local communities in planning and designing the
regeneration projects is still generally low. It is also shown that the regeneration projects in postcommunist
cities are not resolved comprehensively, i.e. that the structures, which are subject to
regeneration, are addressed individually with weak relation to community needs and to the surrounding
areas of a city. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Over the last two decades, China has experienced urban redevelopment at an unprecedented scale and
speed. The state-sponsored property-led redevelopment pattern has been widely deployed as dominant
urban regeneration strategy in many Chinese cities. Meanwhile, more and more attention has been paid
to the protest and resistance of civil society to the tremendous demolition and eviction during the
implementation of such strategies. Investigating the process, content and context of urban regeneration
strategies in China provides fertile ground to understand the public participation process, specific plight
and challenge of decision-making in urban regeneration in China. This reflects the logic and trend of
urban governance in China within existing regulatory practices and institutional settings during the
transformation period. As the understanding of strategy and problem are concomitant to each other,
problem framing in urban regeneration is pivotal to understand urban regeneration strategies. Starting
from this point, the object of this paper is to explore what the problems are, how they are defined and
perceived by different actors, what strategies are promoted as solutions, and how they are legitimated or
excluded. As problem framing is social construction through discourse by different actors, such close
relationship of discourse and problem proves the necessity of undertaking discourse analysis as research
approach to understand problem framing, also the process, content and context of urban regeneration
strategies.
To understand specific problems and challenges of urban regeneration strategies implemented in
China’s inner cities, this study inquires a controversial and well known redevelopment project called
Enning Road, which has been the first “pioneer” in terms of comprehensively redeveloping old town
areas in Guangzhou since the last decade. This project has received tremendous criticism, and it can be
characterized by a continuous adjustment of the unstable strategies that were applied and a frequent
stagnation due to social resistance from 2006 to 2015. It will demonstrate how different discourse coalitions
are formed by the government, scholars, journalists, residents and NGOs and other stakeholders.
For this purpose, the paper will discuss their shared interests, beliefs or rationalities and the way they
use storylines to frame problems. In this context, a lot of local knowledge and expert knowledge is
activated and utilized to construct those storylines. The urban regeneration process of Enning Road involves
continuously changing problem definitions and continuous experimentation, translating into
emergent adaptive strategies. It also shows the interplay between different ways of problem framing, and
the complex interaction between problem framing and strategy promotion. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2020 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The increasing environmental footprints of cities necessitated the integration sustainability principles into urban
planning and development frameworks. The growing attention on urban sustainability also influenced the policy
and the practice of urban regeneration. The quest for new methods for regenerating existing urban quarters in
sustainable manners resulted in the concept of sustainable urban regeneration. The concept aims to develop
urban regeneration projects in line with the three key pillars of sustainable development.
Since the turn of the new millennium, urban regeneration initiatives in Turkish cities have gained a new
momentum, mainly due to the increasing interest by public and private sectors. As expected, squatters constituted
one of the main focuses of the recent initiatives for urban regeneration. Nevertheless, the Turkish experience
of urban regeneration differs from the international experiences in terms of the motivation behind and the
scope of the projects. Despite the growing link between sustainability and urban regeneration in international
practices, sustainability has not yet been a major motivation for urban regeneration practices in Turkey.
This research assesses the sustainability performance of one of the most prominent examples of squatter
regeneration in Turkey, namely the North Ankara Urban Regeneration Project (NAURP). The project has been
evaluated by means of an indicator-based methodology. The research indicates that the project’s contribution to
urban sustainability has been minimal and thus, further efforts are required to improve the sustainability performance
of urban regeneration projects in Turkey. In the light of this finding, policy implications have been
made to push sustainable urban regeneration agenda in Turkey. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gyeongui Line Park is an urban park project that the City of Seoul has adopted as a means to revitalize
declining neighborhoods. This study aims to analyze the project's effects on housing prices. Unlike extant
hedonic studies, this analysis focuses on revealing the heterogeneous effects of the project by the
development process, from inception to completion, to understand when and to what extent the park
has influenced housing values in the host neighborhood. Findings indicate that the Gyeongui Line Park
project has resulted in generally positive externalities to both apartments and multi-family dwellings,
with the magnitude varying by relative locations. The effects differ according to the project's phase and
housing type: in the apartment market, values increased about 15% per 100-m approach to the park,
starting with the announcement of the park's procurement plan in 2006; continued to increase through
Phase I completion; then decelerated to 0e3% at the beginning of Phase II construction. For multi-family
homes, the project corresponded with positive, but smaller increases on housing values (about 2%)
starting with Phase I construction in 2012, with the magnitude remaining at 1e2% from 2012 to the
present. Findings from this study and its methodology will be valuable in determining the course of
future planning efforts to maximize the positive effects of projects in urban revitalization practice. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The green parking project in Korea is an urban regeneration policy created to solve a shortage of parking
space in residential streets by removing the fences of detached houses and creating parking spaces inside
residential properties. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of the green parking project
on the thermal environment of a residential street. Two focused study areas were chosen in Ulsan, Korea
and the physical features of each street were classified into five elements: walls, fenestra, ground
pavement, vegetation, and other objects on streets. The radiant temperature of each element was
collected three times a day with a thermal infrared camera at 3 spots in each street, and pedestrian's
exposure to each element was measured using ArcGIS 10.2. The analytical results indicated that green
parking may reduce pedestrian's exposure to high radiant temperatures on the street through the
replacement of pavement materials on ground, increased exposure to vegetation, decreased exposure to
the parked car, and increased shading on pedestrian walkways. This study suggests that the green
parking project has the potential to improve the thermal environment of outdoor spaces for pedestrians. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2020 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Since the 1990s, European and North American cities started urban regeneration schemes aimed at capturing the
positive side effects of heritage sites along with other cultural facilities. There now exists a wealth of studies
explaining the mechanisms, networks, and effects of this approach. In recent years, many historic cities of China
have initiated similar heritage-led development strategies to manage significant investments for historic urban
areas. In part, current debates discuss the uneven effects of such redevelopment schemes in China, while the
understanding of the internal decision-making network and the mechanisms of real estate appreciation remain
quite limited. Moreover, few investigations have targeted how heritage preservation may be used for generating
and capturing the economic value and how built heritage gets commodified for pro-growth purposes. This paper
investigates the case of the Big Wild Goose Pagoda Area in Xi’an where large-scale real estate, commercial and
tourism developments have been planned around an important heritage site. Through this case, the article
highlights the different public and private actors and the real estate mechanisms that allowed them to both
preserve heritage and benefit from tourism in the immediate surroundings of the Pagoda as well as in the city of
Xi’an as a whole. At the same time, the spatial and economic outcomes of heritage-led development have
negatively affected local communities. This paper calls for further attention to policy networks and planning
arrangements in transforming heritage areas in China. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2014 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Along with the green-land shortage and the low use efficiency of urban land as a result of rapid urban
sprawl in the past three decades, the issue of urban regeneration has been recently brought to the
governance agenda by the new leadership in China. This paper examines the regeneration of the urban
village sector in Guangzhou and finds that the institutional dichotomy of the rural and urban system is
not only the root of the emergence and proliferation of urban villages, but also becomes the obstacle for
their regenerations. The core of urban village regeneration is the redistribution of interest derived from
land appreciation among main stakeholders, and their joint commitment via a collaborative partnership
is the key to the successful project implementation. Though the collaborative approach for urban
regeneration is acknowledged in the West and in the case study, the top-down hierarchical governance
approach, the strong government-dominated ideology as a result of the legacy of socialism, and the
economic-led developmental mode will fundamentally set the form of collaboration in China apart from
other counties. Even within China there is no single universal and prescribed form of collaboration for
urban regeneration due to the variations in terms of geographical, demographical and socio-economic
conditions for urban development. </td>

projects conducted in four most internationalised historical Chinese cities from 1989 to 2005, in
order to understand how traditional architectural elements are manipulated in these projects. It also
examines the roles local governments, developers, designers and local residents played in these projects
in the intensification process of the market oriented economy over time. The paper argues that sociocultural
sustainable regeneration of historical urban environments must make places for local people,
rather than preserve certain traditional forms as cultural symbols. Tradition must evolve by the collective

in order to achieve real cultural identity and social cohesion. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> To advance industrial upgrading, the Government of Shenzhen Nanshan District constantly loosens restrictions
and offers more funding for revitalization, creating incentives for village shareholding corporations
(VSCs) to revitalize old industrial zones. Focusing on the transformation and upgrading of old
industrial zones on collective land based on the case study of Longjing Industrial Zone, this paper investigates
the implementation and effectiveness of the new revitalization policies. First of all, by
comparing the industrial zone before and after the revitalization, the results of the revitalization are
summed up: the renovation of physical environment and infrastructure, the professionalization of
operational models, the diversification of enterprise composition, and the demographic change (the
move-in of more high-income white-collar workers). Then, the performance of the revitalization is
assessed in the aspects of industry cluster and social costs, and the limitation of the transformation and
upgrading of industrial zones is identified. In comparison to government-led revitalization projects,
based on the analysis of the motives and actions of the stakeholders (district government, VSCs, industrial
park operators [IPOs] and tenant enterprises), three underlying factors that exert negative
impact on the effectiveness of revitalization have been found: 1) formalistic industry planning; 2)
recruiting enterprises with loose restrictions; and 3) imperfect regulation, supervision and final acceptance
standards. Finally, based on the above-mentioned limitations and underlying reasons, the paper
proposes suggestions on improving the revitalization of old industrial zones. </td>

all over the world. As a developing country, since 1950, Turkey has been trying to deal with illegal
settlement and construction issues and by the year 2000, it took yet another turn with the concept of
“urban regeneration” in the urban areas. Based on this concept, this article has introduced general
characteristics of slum regeneration and implementation stages of a regeneration project have been
compiled with current data. One of the different implementations has been selected between many other
projects and analyzed from a legal and technical perspective. How the region that was in the world
megaslum list in 2005 had been transformed into the habitable places was explained. Thanks to this
implementation project that contains a special regeneration law for the first time in Turkey, a new
lifestyle has been provided for the gecekondu owners, landownerhip problems have been resolved, and
squatter settlements have been legalized. The project shows that if they are well planned and developed,
including through integrated planning and management approaches, cities can promote economically,
socially, and environmentally sustainable societies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Istanbul’s world-class heritage resources are under serious threat as a result of ineffective conservation
planning. The limited achievements of urban conservation in Istanbul can only be satisfactorily explained
by an analysis that encompasses both the actions of local decision-makers and the structural economic and
political forces which shape the constraints and opportunities within which they act. This perspective
underpins an evaluation of urban conservation in Istanbul since the 1980s and an assessment of prospects
for improving practice. New policy drivers, particularly increased awareness of earthquake risk and the
European Union (EU) harmonisation process, are creating the opportunity to move towards more effective
policies for sustainable urban regeneration.
In the context of the city’s changing planning agenda and priorities, it is argued that the prospects for
more effective conservation planning are improving. It is concluded that more will be achieved if traditional
urban conservation planning is re-conceptualised as a component of sustainable urban regeneration. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Residential displacement by urban regeneration in western economies and passive relocation in
eastern countries have attracted the attention of researchers. Over the past decades, Chinese
megacities have undergone massive passive relocation. They are reforming their old downtown
areas and demolishing substandard housing. The government relocates residents to affordable
city-peripheral large-scale residential areas. These residents are called “relocatees”. So far, few
studies have explored relocatee and non-relocatee on travel-mode-choice preferences and travel
equity in these types of areas with adequate resident samples. To fill this gap, this study conducts
a survey in five peripheral large-scale residential areas in Shanghai, uses statistical analysis of
individual demographic characteristics and transportation-related decisions of relocatees and
non-relocatees, and estimates travel mode choice models for three different groups (relocatee,
non-relocatee, and overall samples). Consumer surplus difference is calculated as a measurement
of travel equity. Results show that compared to non-relocatees, relocatees are older, poorer, and
have a higher mode share of bus and lower mode share of car. Non-relocatees' value of time
(¥25.23 per hour) is greater than relocatees' (¥22.62 per hour). As for travel mode preferences,
for relocatees, the males tend to choose motorcycle, moped or e-bike, then bicycle. For nonrelocatees,
the males tend to choose motorcycle and then car. Relocatee has a ¥6.88 per person
lower travel quality than non-relocatee. Megacity-periphery development and relocation process
have a more negative effect on relocatee’s travel than on other population, from a travel equity
perspective. This study contributes to the literatures on travel behavior and equity in megacity
peripheral areas in developing countries. The findings point to important implications for the
peripheral area’s policy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Angela Curl, Phil Mason </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> There is increased awareness of the role of the urban landscape in promoting walking to counter
the negative health and wellbeing impacts of age-related immobility. Consideration of neighbourhood
design is particularly relevant in the context of local urban regeneration projects,
which are designed to have positive health and wellbeing outcomes. However, few studies explicitly
investigate how the environment influences walking and wellbeing for older adults living
in deprived urban areas.
There are strong conceptual and empirical links between walking, the urban environment and
mental wellbeing. Many studies have separately demonstrated pairwise associations between all
three components. In this paper we address these three concepts empirically, using structural
equation modelling to explore walking as a mediator between the perceived social and built
environments and mental wellbeing for older adults in deprived urban areas.
We found direct and indirect relationships between neighbourhood perceptions and wellbeing.
Walking partially mediates relationships between social contact, neighbourhood quality,
local amenity use, safety and mental wellbeing. Although neighbourhood problems and the
quality of local services and amenities are associated with mental wellbeing, walking is not an
explanatory pathway in our model. The relationship between walking and wellbeing is weaker
than expected.
While promoting walking as a means of achieving positive mental wellbeing among older
adults is important for “active ageing”, it is also necessary to consider the context in which this
takes place, recognising that walking is not the only potential causal pathway between environment
and wellbeing. Where walking is relied upon for transport, the wellbeing implications
may be more complex. Given the strong associations between car ownership and wellbeing,
future research should explore whether mobility and accessibility, rather than walking itself, is
more important for older adults’ wellbeing. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Recent urban studies research emphasizes the unevenness of local responses to immigration in the United States and the emergence of economic development-focused inclusionary initiatives as a
response to neoliberal downscaling in the Rust Belt. Scholars also highlight the impact of austerity urbanism – the deepening of neoliberal urbanism – in Rust Belt cities following the 2007–2008 financial crisis, noting its potential to produce progressive activism.
This article considers the relationship between downscaling,
austerity urbanism, and immigration activism in the Rust Belt by
analyzing economic revitalization narratives within a regional consortium
of inclusionary initiatives. My findings underscore the
incongruities and compromises encompassed by welcoming coalitions
operating in the age of austerity. Some local actors are
motivated by growth agendas but affirm inclusionary values
toward immigrants and refugees to substantiate them. Other
actors are motivated by social justice agendas but cite the economic
benefits of immigration to garner support from other

displacement of low-income people from their homes and neighborhoods is one effect of neighborhood
revitalization initiatives, there is a wider set of factors that constitutes the marginalization,
displacement, and exclusion of certain population groups from effectively making claims
on neighborhood space. Second, in an era of neoliberalization, whereby civil society is expected
to play a larger role in neighborhood governance and the provision of social welfare, the formation
and activities of neighborhood-based communities, and their relation to state and market

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article examines traders’ resistance practices in Kumasi, Ghana
and their significance for changing urban governance in Africa.
Conceptually, we introduce “activism” as a new variable into the
present concept of urban governance as decentralization, entrepreneurialism
and democratization (DED). From an empirical study
in Kumasi, Ghana, findings reveal that activism by non-state actors
does not only occur at the crucial earlier phases of the urban
regeneration process, but extends into the subsequent phases,
because urban governance is a continuous process. We demonstrate
that activism and a multiplicity of resistance practices are
embedded and significant dimensions of everyday urban governance
in Africa. This paper argues that the additional dimension –
activism – is necessary in rethinking urban governance in Ghana
and Africa. This conceptualization views non-state actors not as
resisters of urban governance but as activists whose resistance
practices and innovations produce tangible and far-reaching
changes in city governance. We learn that non-state actors do
not rely on the state to control all aspects of urban governance
but invent new practices to secure their socio-economic interests
and provide them with leverage where they have to negotiate
with or stand up to authorities. The study shows that successful
change in urban governance is a function of the complementary
and strategic adoption of contention, subversion and coproduction.
When the state perceives that the intervention of
other key stakeholders legitimizes the grievances of non-state
actors, it responds positively. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2007 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper uses a case study of Business Improvement Districts in downtown
Milwaukee to illustrate two key trends in contemporary urban revitalization. First, it highlights
the ways in which the relationship between the public and private sectors continues to be reconfigured
in the governance of cities. Second, it considers the roles of Business Improvement
Districts in light of the current emphasis among urban policymakers and practitioners on delivering
“cool” and “liveable” cities. I argue that Business Improvement Districts play a central role
in overseeing the contemporary restructuring of urban space in many U.S. cities. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article investigates the birth and evolution of a Business
Improvement District (BID) in Talimhane, Istanbul, which is the
first case of use of this instrument of neoliberal governance in
the Turkish city. The distinctive nature of the Talimhane BID consists
in the fact that it has been developed through a series of
informal and piecemeal arrangements. The article first reviews the
evolution, characteristics, and critical aspects of BIDs. It then
focuses on the case study of this “informal BID” in Talimhane,
analysing its origins, features, and outcomes. The informal nature
of this BID is stressed as a key factor in understanding its features
and outcomes, and it emerges as a fundamental component of
urban neoliberalism in Turkey: it allows a centralized and authoritarian
government to maintain complete control over public
space and private actors and activities, while promoting a process
of devolving powers in favour of the private sector. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Downtown Phoenix and Houston are changing. They are not
dense, historic downtowns; instead, they reflect contemporary
downtown growth in sprawling cities. Both cities have reimagined
their downtowns, leveraging vacant land, new construction, and
infill projects. Through this process, developers are shaping downtown
in response to market demand. This research explores how
developers in two Sun Belt cities are thinking about Millennials
and cementing their preferences into rapidly changing downtowns.
We triangulate data from the U.S. Census, regional media,
and interviews with 22 downtown development experts. We find
developers respond to Millennial preferences in several ways. They
are endowing their downtown projects with a greater sense of
place and diversity of activities. However, there is a social cost:
underlying concerns include rising housing costs and gentrification
in the downtowns and reduced demand for housing in the
suburbs, particularly if Millennials elect to stay downtown for the long term. </td>

Its proponents argue that they can inform more incremental and

temporary uses can become vehicles for the short-term and
conditional delivery of social benefits. In this paper, I analyse a community-
oriented interim use project commissioned by a public

urban regeneration program. Drawing upon policy analysis and
interviews with planners, policymakers, architects and community

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The aim of this research is to utilize a novel approach called
geographically weighted shift-share (GWSSA) analysis to estimate
the degree and manner to which recent destination redevelopments
have played a role in changing the characteristics of the
nearby population and housing in Detroit between 1990 and 2010.
The main benefit of geographically weighted shift-share analysis is
that this technique isolates the local changes due to such projects
while simultaneously controlling for the amount of the change
expected for unrelated factors (e.g., the exodus of people leaving
Detroit due to its overall negative reputation). Results suggest that
such destination redevelopments in Detroit seem to be connected
to a number of surprising positive local impacts during this period
related to total population, 18-to-29-year-olds, non-Hispanic
whites, employed civilians, unemployed civilians, households earning
between $50,000 and $100,000 in annual income, total housing
units, occupied housing units and vacant housing units. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neoliberal economic transformations in developing countries do
not necessarily lead to political decentralization, which sets them
apart from advanced capitalist contexts. The field of urban regeneration
is a case in point where central governments in such
countries have become the primary policy-makers, leaving local
governments with minimal decision-making power. This article
focuses on three atypical regeneration projects initiated by municipalities
in Turkey, a highly centralized country undergoing rapid
neoliberalization. It seeks to understand the factors that enable
municipal governments to control regeneration processes within
their jurisdiction. It argues that success of local initiatives depends
on relations with the center and the ability of the local leadership
to mobilize local stakeholders around a common vision. The findings
are based on field research conducted in the three regeneration
sites in three cities. The main data sources are in-depth
interviews with politicians and stakeholders, descriptive statistics
and the local and national print media. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2014 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In this article, I develop a critical analysis of the relationship between urban “revitalization”
campaigns and the regulation of street children in Lima, Peru. Scholars
writing mostly in the Global North have drawn attention to increasingly punitive
policies regarding public space. While in many regards Lima’s urban policy is reflective
of such larger trends, I consider whether the regulation of street children is as
punitive as might be assumed. I am particularly concerned with the role that children’s
rights play as another logic structuring urban regulation. I first show how a language of
children’s rights has been manipulated to justify the removal of street children from
public space, as is most evident through Peru’s Law to Protect Minors from Situations
of Begging. However, there is also something more ambiguous occurring. In the
second part of this article, I examine the uneven implementation of policy: street
children themselves resist and rework policies “on the ground,” and children’s rights
frameworks may offer possibilities for rupture of formal regulation. I suggest that these
overlapping and competing dynamics sustain an uneven and contingent geography of
urban regulation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This study draws upon the urban theory of Henri Lefebvre to examine HOPE VI, a
public housing demolition and redevelopment program administered by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development. Hailed as a new approach to urban policy, the HOPE VI
program embodies many of the key tenets of neoliberal urbanization, including an emphasis on
entrepreneurial forms of urban regeneration and a focus on individual responsibility. To provide
a lens for understanding this neoliberalization of space, we first detail Lefebvre’s theorization of
abstract space and transparency, highlighting in particular its nondialectical and depoliticized
character. We then turn to examine the HOPE VI model and its implementation in Charlotte,
North Carolina. Lefebvre’s analysis, we argue, provides a useful entry point for interpreting the
re-envisioning of urban space that underlies HOPE VI–style redevelopment, and therefore can
potentially inform contemporary struggles against neoliberal urban policy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In this article, I contribute to recent debates about the concept of neoliberalism and its
use as an explanatory concept, through the analysis of urban planning and regeneration
policy in Lisbon amidst crisis and austerity. Suggesting a look at neoliberalization from
a threefold perspective—the project, governmentalities, and policymaking—I analyze
how current austerity-policy responses to the European economic crisis can be understood
as a renewed and coherent deployment of neoliberal stances. The article presents
implications for urban planning in Lisbon and thus suggests an exploration of the
negotiations and clashes of hegemonic neoliberal governmentalities and policies with
the local social and spatial fabric. For this exploration, I select a “deviant” case—the
Mouraria neighborhood, a “dense” space in which the consequences of policies
diverge sharply from expectations. In conclusion, I suggest that neoliberalization (in
times of crisis) should be understood as a coherent project compromised by a set of
highly ambiguous governmentalities, which bring about contradictory policymaking at
the local level. </td>

planners turned toward Havana's UNESCO World Heritage district (Habana Vieja, or Old
Havana). Profound historic preservation, architectural renewal, and modernization of infrastructure
characterized the development efforts of the old quarters during the 1990s. In the process,
issues emerged that are germane to urban revitalization, historic preservation and restructuring.

Houston's late-20th century urban redevelopment initiatives occurred during a period in history
Chinese entrepreneurs lost their influence over the local growth machine. The eventual outcome
was the erasure of Houston’s downtown Chinatown and the displacement of its residents from their
lucrative urban core location. The disappearance of Old Chinatown and other urban ethnic neighborhoods—
including Little Saigon and Freedmen’s Town—from the urban core all took place
as the Houston media and public were celebrating diversity, pluralism, and ethnicity in the city. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In recent years, growing academic attention has been placed upon
the varied strategies of rightsizing employed by cities to address
the interrelated dynamics of economic and urban decline and
depopulation. Within this body of work, the focus has primarily
been placed on the city-level. By focusing on the practices and
politics of urban revitalization within the Idora neighborhood in
Youngstown – a neighborhood widely heralded as a success story
– this paper deepens understandings of how rightsizing is enacted
within more micro-contexts. Drawing on demographic data, documentary
analysis, and observation, it reveals the process to be
complex in its manifestations. Placing the critical gaze upon the
neighborhood level exposes actualities of urban reconfiguration in
the context of stark deindustrialization, decline, and depopulation,
elucidating the actors and practices involved, in addition to its
politically charged and contested nature. It concludes with a discussion
of the wider implications of this case study both in terms
of the possibilities and pitfalls of rightsizing. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article argues that contested cities are inherently characterized by
uncertainty and uses the interconnections between conflict, uncertainty
and urban planning as a new analytical framework for investigating
conflict cities. In the contested city of Jerusalem, geopolitical
uncertainty stems from the Israeli occupation over East Jerusalem.
Focusing on recent urban regeneration plans for West Jerusalem’s
city center, the article explores how the municipality locates, plans
and imagines the city center when the city’s external and internal
boundaries are contested and unfixed. A two-tier analysis is employed.
First, a historical analysis shows that the “city center”, as defined by
authorities, is an unfixed locale that shifts in concurrence with shifts in
the city’s boundaries. Then, a geopolitical analysis shows that by
shifting the city center’s boundaries, the Israeli authorities decouple
the city’s economic development (in the west) from Israel’s continuing
ethno-national policies (in the east). </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2013 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper explores the dynamics behind the changing regimes of urban renewal and
its social impacts in Taiwan. Before the 1980s, the state was willing to solely shoulder the job of
urban renewal with a wholly supportive financial budget and land appropriation law, while in the
1990s it became financially overburdened due to its renewal policy. Around the year 2000, the
state turned towards promoting urban regeneration as a key business model. Through this
historical exposition, the Taiwanese story of state transformation in urban renewal policy brings
two issues to the fore. The first issue is the learning process concerning the policy of publicprivate
partnership (PPP) initiatives. Transborder policy mobility connects and constitutes cities,
such as Taipei, with other places, such as London, through visits and seminars attended by policy
makers and experts. However, policy transferred from abroad is “localized” in the learning
process and used to prioritize the regeneration of public lands in the urban area. The PPP
model is transformed in the face of domestic political struggles. The second issue is the social
exclusion as a result of property-led regeneration. Rather than playing the role of an impartial
institutional moderator, the state privileged landowners and developers and sacrificed the rights of
tenants to stay put. By doing so, the state secures political support from landowner-cum-citizens
and initiates a political culture of property in which local citizenship is predicated on ownership. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2008 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In the second half of the 20th century, considerable resources and efforts have been
devoted to revitalizing American central cities. In these redevelopment processes, however, the
common byproduct of physical upgrading is social upgrading, the displacement of many of the
original residents, who are often low-income and minority, from their traditional neighborhoods.
This article explores the various processes of physical and social upgrading—including locally
driven urban renewal, private sector “blockbusting,” and gentrification—occurring in late 20th
century Houston, Texas. This research also examines the neighborhood characteristics and
demographic patterns that influence the occurrence of specific upgrading processes. One location
of particular interest in the study is Houston’s historic African American community of
Freedmen’s Town, which has experienced decades of conflict over land and space. Most
recently, Freedmen’s Town has been at the focus of Houston’s urban revival, where physical
upgrading has been accompanied by the displacement of the community’s traditional population
and the destruction of this historic neighborhood. </td>

program “Stadtumbau Ost” [Urban Regeneration East] as a

paper discusses how this program came into being. Based on
expert interviews and document analysis, it demonstrates that
the primary cause for “Stadtumbau Ost” was not so much a new
development policy for depopulated cities, but rather an attempt
to manage tackle an acute crisis of large housing companies.
These exerted enormous influence on policy-making and made
sure that new policies were designed in a way that would benefit
their interests. At the same time, the new program was based on
established federal funding policies which made the integration of
planning principles vital. The outcome is a hybrid, combining a
market shakeout with visions of sustainable planning. </td>

discussions about the hegemonic status of neoliberalism as a theoretical concept and as an
analytical framework and on discussions about the travels of dominant critiques of neoliberalism
beyond the sites of epistemological production. The article argues that the current analytical
overinvestment in neoliberalism may obscure important drivers of contemporary urbanization
and that recourse to a diversity of concepts may be a more profitable line of inquiry. The article
suggests that current efforts at epistemological renewal within urban studies benefit from taking
up cities in the “borderlands” of urban theory as relevant cases in their own right. The article
offers further considerations on the purchase of neoliberalism in contemporary urban literature. </td>

In addition to stimulating ridership the paper focusses on the opportunities to create synergy between public transport and urban revitalization. A plea is made for a systematic structure of the public transport network in which light rail could play a prominent role as the interconnecting transport system. In this way light rail could bring about a physical integration between urban and urban district public transport.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Martin Wachs </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2013 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> North American urban areas have changed dramatically over the last four decades.
While downtowns were thought to be in long-term decline 40 years ago, central
business districts are today the most vibrant residential and commercial centers throughout a
largely suburban continent. This paper examines the role of transportation technology and
policy in the earlier decline and recent revival of American downtowns and examines
challenges to the continuation of urban regeneration. Major recent investments in physical
improvements in central cities have been complemented by a dramatic shift in the locus of
logistical and goods processing activities from city centers to outlying areas. While many tout
the energy efficiency and environmental benefits of walkable and denser inner cities, a more
complete accounting of their impacts also requires analysis of increasing urban congestion
and the steady rise in urban goods movement in support of the new development patterns. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In the post-Fordist economy, culture has become an important resource for cities to compete at
the regional and international levels. Thus, local elites have used culture as an instrument of urban
regeneration and these processes increasingly seek to promote urban branding. Moreover, culture
is seen as a way to generate narratives that help cities avoid the perception of standardisation,
characterise cities as a unique urban space and create authenticity, which are necessary
elements if a city is to be globally competitive. The case of central Barcelona and, specifically, the
Raval district is exemplary and singular: the joint action of the cultural institutions and representatives
of the cultural sector based in the neighbourhood have turned the Raval into an brand space
of ‘authentic Barcelona’ that makes the official, tourist-frequented Barcelona more rich and
complex. </td>

assessment of the effectiveness of
physical regeneration initiatives on
run-down industrial sites in the
Netherlands </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2015 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Despite the widespread use of physical improvements as a strategy to regenerate deprived and rundown
urban areas, there is only limited evidence on the precise impact of these kinds of regeneration
activities. A number of conceptual and methodological problems that impinge on all evaluations of
regeneration policies have constrained the required evidence base. This paper evaluates the impact of
publicly funded physical improvements of run-down industrial sites in the Netherlands and seeks to
address several of these challenges; namely, selecting appropriate comparison areas, attributing change
to specific interventions, access to small-scale, longitudinal data and selecting outcomes congruent with
policy goals and rationales. Pooled data from various sources provide us with information on regeneration
initiatives and other site characteristics for more than half of all sites in the country. Propensity
score matching enables us to systematically compare economic outcomes related to regeneration policy
goals between sites that have been subjected to regeneration and those that have not. The results
of this study suggest that physical regeneration of industrial sites has a negligible effect on economic
outcomes that are related to the most commonly articulated policy goals: the increase of employment,
of firm numbers, of property values and of the intensity of land use on these sites. These findings add
to a small but growing body of work that investigates the economic impact of regeneration programmes
that fund physical investments on commercial and industrial areas. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neoliberal accounts of local governance have paid insufficient attention to variation in the forms
of urban governance and urban policies across local regimes. On the basis of a comparison of
eight deprived neighbourhoods in Catalonia (Spain) where the same regional programme of urban
regeneration has been carried out, this paper explores the significance of place when it comes to
understanding the adoption of different models of urban governance. In Spain, the combination of
a high autonomy of local government and a very strong tradition of neighbourhood associations
has resulted in both local authorities and community organisations playing a very important role
in local policy-making. Local structural and agency factors are both essential to understanding
why models of urban governance and regeneration change from place to place. The paper concludes
that neighbourhood type, size of municipality, social capital and previous conflicts are crucial
for the understanding of urban governance geographies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2017 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Urban regeneration (UR) programmes are recognised as a type of Population Health Intervention
(PHI), addressing social and health inequalities. Policy recommends programmes involve communities
through engagement and empowerment. Whilst the literature has started to link empowerment
with health improvement, this has not been within an UR context. As part of broader
research on the economic evaluation of community empowerment activities, this paper examines
how health gains can be generated through promoting empowerment as well as identifying
whether feelings of empowerment are associated with residents personal characteristics or perceptions
of their neighbourhood. Using 2011 Community Health and Wellbeing Survey (GoWell)
cross-sectional data, ordinal logistic regression and simple linear regression analysis of
15 Glasgow neighbourhoods undergoing regeneration with 4302 adult householders ( 16 years
old) was completed. Analyses identified strong associations (P  0.05) between empowerment
and the mental health subscale of the SF12v2 and with several items of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) scale. Furthermore, residents’ who felt more empowered
reported more positive attitudes towards their surroundings and housing providers. This concurs
with recent evidence of the importance of residents’ psychological investments in their neighbourhood
influencing their sense of place attachment. Such analyses present initial evidence of
the value of investing resources within UR programmes to activities geared towards increasing
residents’ empowerment as a means of producing those health gains often sought by more costly
aspects of the programmes. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Drawing on the literature of post-politics and post-democracy, the literature of neoliberalism as
mode of governance and the study of the city of Valencia’s long-standing emphasis on the development
of prestige mega-projects of iconic architecture as a means to achieve economic regeneration
and urban revitalisation, this paper evaluates the social and economic effects of urban
mega-projects and analyses them as conduits of neoliberal globalisation and de-politicisation of
the public sphere.
On the one hand, an urban policy based on the use of mega-projects represents a turn from welfarism
to entrepreneurialism which, beyond the evident urban transformation and re-imaging,
results in an increase in social inequality, the creation of precarious jobs, and an underinvestment
in social services.
On the other hand, the mechanisms used to implement mega-projects – including both exceptionality
measures and privatisation of management through the creation of semi-public delivery
bodies – result in a lack of transparency and democratic control, which in turn lead to more
authoritative and privatised forms of decision-making. Moreover, mega-projects – through their
focus on expertise and technocracy and a populist politics and discourse constructed around
them – play a crucial role in the erosion of democracy and the establishment of a consensual politics
where ideological struggle does not exist. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article offers the concept of tangential attachments as a way to interpret the meaning of
urban regeneration for local residents. This contribution to the critical study of cultural regeneration
allows us to consider the multiple ways in which urban transformation can impact on local
identities and attachments to place. It recognises the sometimes fleeting and at-arms-length connections
residents can have to places of urban regeneration, and thereby positions the experience
of urban regeneration as one part of complex, processual relationships between people and place.
The article extends literatures which critique the social and cultural impacts of regeneration, and
offers a more nuanced understanding of how people engage with regenerated urban environments.
Principally, it offers a framework that goes beyond a binary presented by some in the literature
between the enhancing and undermining of attachments. The article does this by drawing
on phenomenogical perspectives of place and the concepts of memory and affect. The empirical
work presented in the article demonstrates the tangential nature of attachments to urban regeneration,
and is comprised of original in-depth research interviews with residents of a local community
in Newcastle upon Tyne in the UK. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2012 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The development of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems world-wide has witnessed tremendous growth in recent years, most notably in cities throughout the developing world. These large, city-wide transportation projects are often central to larger urban revitalization plans intending to foster economic growth and alter city images to both residents and to outsiders. Crucial to the success of such ambitions is a system that provides equitable access to all residents and one that provides access to a large number of urban opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to explore the spatial accessibility landscape created by newly implemented BRT system in Cali, Colombia in terms of both access to the system itself and access to three distinct activities around the city. In particular, the equitable distribution of accessibility patterns is explored in relation to neighborhood socio-economic strata. Findings indicate that walking access to the BRT system is greatest for middle income groups and most limited for neighborhoods in the highest and lowest socio-economic strata. Accessibility values to activities are largely bound to the spatial distribution pattern of activities; most equitable for intentionally dispersed recreation site, and least for spatially clustered hospitals. </td>

and the 2012 Olympic Games </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2014 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Global events such as London’s 2012 Olympic Games raise questions about the ways in
which embedded political arrangements take their shape from relationships that stretch
across and beyond urban boundaries. In this article, the urban politics that we wish to
capture is not one that is merely located in the city, but rather one that has to constantly
take into account the mediated demands folded (as it were) into the urban arena. In the
first part of the article, the corporate politics of an Olympic-related urban regeneration
are outlined and then considered, first as a staged setting for interaction, a kind of
placeless political engagement, and then as a more embedded spatial politics that takes
into account the leverage of networked groups acting within and beyond the city.
Following that, we explore the politics of regeneration when campaign groups and
alternative coalitions of interest raise their own political demands by drawing on
references outside of their immediate urban area and attempt to steer political dialogue
in ways that extend the reach of urban politics. The urban politics at stake in this context,
we argue, appears to work more through topology than a series of mapped connections;
through actors registering their presence in ways that often dissolve the tension between
inside and outside rather than define it in terms of separate political spaces. </td>

Creative Brownfields in the Cities of High Culture </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Lauren Andres, Oleg Golubchikov </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Despite the burgeoning literature on creative cities, seldom explored is the context
of cities rich in cultural capital but more orthodox in their approach to preserving the
autonomy
of culture. This article discusses the status of artistic spaces occupying abandoned
industrial premises (‘creative brownfields’) in historic cities that traditionally shape
their policies around prestigious cultural institutions (‘cities of high culture’). Based on
comparative insights from St Petersburg and Lausanne, the article explores the relations
and tensions between mainstream cultural governance and creative brownfields. While
there is no lack of creative brownfields in these cities, their wider urban impact is found
to be marginal; moreover, these sites represent dispersed instances of temporary occupations
rather than situated clusters of creative actors. More than coincidental, this (lack
of ) spatialization is argued to result from a particular governmentality –– that of high
culture –– which disregards, rather than promotes, spaces of alternative cultural governance.
The article conceptualizes creative brownfields in cities of high culture as the ‘soft
infrastructure’ of cultural production, in contrast with those in ‘creative cities’ as the ‘hard
infrastructure’ of urban production. The article also calls for a recognition of the local
context of regulation and accumulation in understanding the cultural/urban interplay. </td>

afforded to them. It seeks to understand how community groups manage the challenges
they face in times of neoliberal urbanism. This study follows calls to pay greater attention to
the existence of imaginaries other than neoliberal ones, examining community actions and
discourses surrounding the Historic Area Rejuvenation Project (HARP) area in Dublin,
a project aimed at stimulating private property development and investment. The case
highlights
tensions between the pursuit of community-based and collaborative urban
regeneration
and the increased legitimacy of neoliberalism as a guiding principle of public
policy. It confirms the existence of resistance movements and the importance of local
and national contexts in explaining the outcomes of contestation. Despite participative
structures established
by the local authority, the views and interests of local community
activists were ignored and excluded. Furthermore, in contrast to trends towards co-option
within participative
structures, the community actively resisted the imposition of neoliberal
plans. Overall,
while they had little success in influencing the plans or mindsets
of the local authority, they did succeed in delaying the process until the project became
unviable as a result of the economic crisis. </td>

these policies, women and families currently play an important role as gentrification
pioneers. In my analysis of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, I propose the term
genderfication to understand the gender dimensions of this process. Genderfication
refers to the production of space for different gender relations. I analyse Rotterdam’s
urban planning program for becoming a ‘child-friendly city’, which entails replacing
existing urban dwellings with new, larger and more expensive ‘family-friendly homes’as
a strategy for urban re-generation. Urban re-generation supplements regeneration in the
form of material and economic restructuring, and refers to the replacement of part of the
current population by a new and better suited generation. The ‘child-friendly city
program’ is considered in tandem with punitive ‘youth policies’. </td>

Regeneration: The Case of Haliç (the
Golden Horn), Istanbul </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2008 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article analyzes the efforts to regenerate Istanbul’s urban waterfront area of Haliç
(the Golden Horn), since the mid-1980s, from the perspective of the actors involved and
their power dynamics. It uses as examples three projects: the Fener-Balat neighborhood
rehabilitation, Feshane Cultural Center, and Rahmi M. Koç Museum initiatives.
It argues that the case of Haliç cannot be understood through concepts such as
the public-private partnerships, intense processes of urban entrepreneurialism,
gentrification etc., which have often explained the experience of the North American and
Western European city. Instead, this process has been shaped by a top-down initiative on
the part of public sector actors initially, and a lack of private sector involvement,
ambivalent public sector actors and reluctant local communities subsequently. One
needs to highlight the particularities of the institutional arrangements and urban politics
at the district, city and national levels in order to explain the case of Haliç. These
concern low amounts of self-generated revenue in district and metropolitan
municipalities, the specificities to be found in the local community–municipality
relations in Istanbul, the presence of a relatively weak private sector in Turkey and,
finally, the unfavorable market position of Haliç more generally and the projects in
question more specifically. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article focuses on the emergence of ‘low-carbon’ gentrification as a distinct urban
phenomenon, a process that we see as the outcome of efforts to change the social and spatial
composition of urban districts under the pretext of responding to climate change and energy
efficiency imperatives. The article develops a conceptual framework for scrutinizing lowcarbon
gentrification, predicated upon insights from literatures on ecological gentrification
and displacement. It documents the existence of an ‘eco-social paradox’ associated with
new patterns of socio-spatial segregation and energy efficiency retrofits. We interrogate
the discursive and policy frameworks, socio-spatial implications and political contestations
of low-carbon gentrification. Evidence is drawn from case study research in an inner-city
district of the Polish city of Gdańsk, where such processes have been unfolding since 2006
due to the implementation of a targeted urban regeneration programme. This investigation is
positioned within a wider analysis of secondary written sources about similar developments
in other geographical contexts across Europe and North America, where anecdotal evidence
suggests that low-carbon gentrification may be widespread and common. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2007 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article is based on a study of Docklands in London, which was undertaken as part
of a larger study of gentrification in inner London. Using interview and survey data, the
article compares Docklands with the gentrification that has taken place elsewhere in
inner London. Whilst there were important differences between these inner-London study
areas, all differ qualitatively from the process in Docklands. The article questions
whether the distinction that is normally drawn between ‘gentrification by capital’ and
‘gentrification by collective social action’ is appropriate and argues that this disguises
the nature of the urban regeneration being undertaken in Docklands. It is suggested that
this is more a process of re-urbanization in which some of the characteristics normally
associated with suburban development are being brought to an area near the centre of
the city, but in a context more normally reserved for gentrification. The data from the
survey show that for many of the respondents in Docklands, the kind of life they are
seeking is often associated with some conceptions of suburban life. It is suggested that
both gentrification and suburbanization as concepts need to be used with care in
understanding contemporary processes of re-urbanization such as are occurring in
Docklands and the central areas of other British cities. </td>

writing on urban monopoly rents especially, we show how the 22@Barcelona project —
conceived with received wisdom about the determinants of urban knowledge-based
competitiveness in mind — amounted to an exercise in the capture of monopoly rents,
driven by the compulsion of public sector institutions, financiers and developers to
pursue rental profit-maximizing opportunities through the mobilization of land as a

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article explores the influence of international financial capital on the production of
exclusionary housing markets and spatialities in the city of Prague, Czech Republic. It
focuses on the regeneration of Karlín, a district of Prague increasingly defined by the
presence of luxury housing and high-specification office developments. Through a
critical discussion of two private companies heavily implicated in the renewal of the
district, it is possible to examine the ways in which these actors are contributing to this
regeneration. I argue that the regeneration of the district is intimately bound up with
processes of capitalist uneven development that couple networks of foreign investors
with local municipal authorities through an asymmetric set of power relations. These
relations are heavily skewed in favour of the private sector, and the complexity of the
linkages between these actors makes meaningful regulation of foreign investment
extremely challenging. I also suggest that such practices should not be seen as a
transitory position between state socialist planning mechanisms and mature ‘Western’
practices of regeneration, but rather as explicitly post-socialist in nature, and only as a
partial reading of a number of different post-socialisms, instead of being seen as
representative of a singular ‘post-socialist condition’. </td>

The ‘Barcelona model’ has evolved, however, with changing relationships between
urban regeneration, the use of culture and modes of governance. The role of cultural
strategy has shifted from being part of a cultural vernacular with social and political
citizenship at its core to become a functional tool for ensuring social cohesion
and marketing the city’s brand. This is linked to a gradual dilution of bottom-up
participatory democracy in governance. Pressures for international competitiveness are
challenging the sustainability of the ‘Barcelona model’, while local actors are trying to

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The spreading of city improvement districts (CIDs) and connected forms of
public–private partnership as an international model of urban renewal has been linked
to the rise of ‘urban entrepreneurialism’ and the neoliberalization of policies and
practices, at a time when competition between cities in the global economy has never
been greater. The aim of this article is to explore the transfer and adaptation of the CID
model in two cities of the South, Johannesburg and Cape Town. Arguing that CIDs are
an example of the local embeddedness of neoliberalism, we highlight the role of the
private sector in importing and adapting CIDs in South Africa, and point out the rise of
techno-politicians in CID management. Paying particular attention to discourses, we
analyse the way images of decaying urban centres were used to legitimate the adoption
of such schemes. The subsequent transformation of the model also enables us to explore
the specificity of the adoption of this international best practice model in South Africa
and its further circulation at the Southern African level. We conclude that while CIDs in
South Africa raise familiar North American issues regarding the private management of
public spaces, they also question the very nature of the African city model proposed and
envisioned locally. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Both Rotterdam’s Kop van Zuid and the Glasgow Harbour waterfront developments are
examples of different forms of European urban entrepreneurial megaprojects. They are
both situated on formerly vacant land in older industrial cities. In Rotterdam, the
municipality has taken the initiative in planning and developing the megaproject, while
in Glasgow, this task has been left to the private sector, with the City functioning as a
facilitator. While urban entrepreneurialism and megaprojects have been discussed in
academic literature for almost three decades, there are too few case studies which delve
into the specific visions guiding these projects, the goals which they are meant to achieve
and the positions which different actors play. The aim of this article is to analyze the
relationship between these visions, goals and positions of actors in megaprojects and
whether these relationships can explain how the different outcomes are produced. What
we see is that in municipally-led projects, entrepreneurial goals are more easily formed
and implemented than when the public sector acts only as a facilitator to private
developers. It will also argue that it is not only structural contexts which are important
in determining the types of megaprojects which get built and the success which they
achieve, but also the specific values, visions and goals that different stakeholders have. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The post-2001 financial crisis era in Turkey gave rise to twin booms in housing
construction and credit markets, both of which suffered from the subsequent debt crisis.
The financial transformation of the economy in conjunction with state-led urban legislation
reform had significant effects on the housing market in terms of commodification of
housing, countrywide construction activities and substantial increases in household
debt and construction company loans. The changing role and function of the state as a
direct provider of housing can be regarded as actually existing neoliberalism providing
favourable conditions for financialization, as it ushered in the commodification of
housing. The Turkish government, together with the government-backed housing agency,
metropolitan municipalities and publicly owned real-estate investment company, has been
active in nationwide housing construction and urban regeneration projects. This article
argues that there is a lack of synchrony between the commodification of housing and the
financialization of the household sector owing to the institutional setting of the mortgage
system and structural macroeconomic problems. Rather, housing commodification has
been accompanied by the financialization of the corporate sector through a steep rise in the
external debt burden of construction companies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Old industrial cities have made broad use of new strategies as the means to overcome the difficulties created by the restructuring of their former economic basis. Although usually based on physical practices, these strategies have attempted to ease the transformation towards a services‐based economy, which has been presented as the essential means to solve the cities’ economic problems. Even if it has been of widespread currency, the effectiveness of this formula is not clear, as its impact on the city of Glasgow illustrates. Yet, at present, Bilbao, a Basque variant of one of those old industrial cities, is making use of the same ideas to legitimate its own current renewal, through focusing upon the misleading message that comes from Glasgow’s apparent success in urban regeneration. The article underlines the poor scope of the success achieved by such a strategy in old industrial contexts facing serious unemployment problems. </td>

Politics of Scales Approach to the Study
of Urban Policy </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2006 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In this article I explore how theoretical metaphors about the contemporary rescaling of
the capitalist economy are used by local policy actors to justify an entrepreneurial urban
policy. I develop a new theoretical concept (scalar narrative), suggest an analytical
approach (cultural politics of scales) and give evidence of a particular case (Bilbao).
The article is structured in the following way. First, I briefly review the literature on
politics of scales and contribute to the debate with an approach that incorporates
elements from cultural political economy and interpretative policy analysis. Within this
approach I mobilize the concept of ‘scalar narrative’ that has already been suggested
in the literature but not fully explored. I then put this approach into practice with a
particular case study, Bilbao, a city in the north of Spain, which has recently gone
through extensive urban regeneration, where I describe the appropriation of three scalar
narratives by the policymakers. To show this I draw from empirical work done in Bilbao
that looks at statutory and strategic planning documents as well as urban marketing
literature and interviews with key informants. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Urban villages are widespread in many Chinese cities, providing affordable and
accessible housing for rural migrants. These urban villages develop rapidly over time
to create more housing units and accommodate increasing numbers of residents. This
article provides systematic analyses of urban village development in Shenzhen in the
period 1999–2009. It reveals that the development of urban villages was driven by the
overall planning and urban growth of the city, which resulted in significant variation in
urban village development at the city scale. Three distinct but overlapping phases were
observed: expansion, densification and intensification. The growth of urban villages
was spatially clustered and changes over time in the distribution of growth centres
suggest the possible diffusion of migrant employment out of the Special Economic
Zone into two outer districts. In the recent urban regeneration process, the pattern and
trend of urban village development is shown to contradict the city’s urban village
redevelopment programmes. This not only helps to explain the slow progress of the
policy implementation, but also implies severe risks of jeopardizing the migrant
housing market in certain urban sections. </td>

Contradictory Perspectives on Urban Change in the Berlin District of Neukölln </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2015 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In the past two decades, the Berlin district of Neukölln has received considerable
attention from politicians, planners, urban scholars and the media. This article discusses
the role that the academic concepts of ‘social mixing’ and ‘gentrification’ play in the overlapping
and partly contradictory narratives that have been employed to interpret transformations
in one particular part of the district, Nord-Neukölln. While the area is still
characterized
as a place of poverty and decline, it has more recently come to be known as a
‘hip place to be’ among young (creative) urbanites, students and artists. Various urban players
such as politicians, planners, urban sociologists, activists, interest groups and the media
participate in the construction of these narratives and, in the process, adopt the concepts
of social mixing and gentrification according to their respective rationales and preferences.
Both concepts play a pivotal role in justifying contradictory claims and interventions.
As a consequence, ‘social mixing’ and ‘gentrification’ are more than just analytical
concepts for interpreting urban transformations; they have themselves become part of
these transformations
and have an impact on local developments. We conclude that urban
scholarship must reflect more on its own role and positioning in the arena of urban
transformation. </td>

Cases from Mexico City and Buenos Aires </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2009 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article addresses the issue of culture-led urban regeneration from a Latin American
perspective. It argues that, despite limited government intervention, the democratization
processes that many cities have undergone have enhanced the potential of urban cultural
policy as an instrument to address economic, social and physical decay. Grounded on the
cases of Mexico City and Buenos Aires, the article shows how highly contingent and
contradictory processes of economic globalization, political democratization and
institutional neoliberalization have led to much variation in urban policy. In this context,
we argue that urban cultural policy is highly dependent on the intricacies of local
configurations of power and the negotiation of policy agendas. As a third level of
analysis, the article looks at one paradigmatic project in each city. These experiences
reveal that cultural initiatives offer the potential to generate socially inclusive forms of
economic and territorial development at both the city and neighborhood scales. Yet we
also point out that existing fiscal and political constraints limit the extent to which they
can be replicated and articulated into a wider policy agenda. The article ends with a
discussion of the comparative findings and a research agenda to examine governmental
and non-governmental culture-led urban regeneration initiatives. </td>

urban sustainability and creative planning. We then explore their convergence with
economic development, both in theory and practice, and raise critical questions about
the universal applicability of these formulas. We conclude with a conceptual discussion
of the problems these discourses represent. In particular, we reveal how these discourses
create consensus among diverse (often competing) groups of actors, and the problems
associated with this form of ‘consensual urban politics’. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2003 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In this article the ambivalence of public policy responses to diversity on the street are documented empirically through a detailed case study of the marginalization of youth from the downtown public spaces of Portland, Maine, USA. Urban planners, architects and property developers have become increasingly concerned with improving the quality of urban life and the public spaces on which it depends. They argue that urban revitalization initiatives must embrace diversity — cultural and economic, as well as functional and spatial. This diversity of different ‘diversities’ is often under‐theorized, as are the benefits of, and relationships among, social and cultural diversity, economic diversification, mixed‐use and multi‐purpose zoning, political pluralism, and democratic public space. It is my contention that this ambivalence is not simply a smokescreen for vested commercial interests, but also provides opportunities for expressing alternative visions of what diversity and the city itself should be. Looking specifically at youth, I explore a relatively underexamined aspect of inner‐city diversity. While there is a relatively well‐developed literature about the contested place of low‐income groups, racial minorities and the homeless in urban redevelopment initiatives, youth have largely been ignored. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The mission of a museum is essentially cultural, however this is not the case for all
museums. There are a minority of universally famous museums, like the Tate Liverpool,
the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, the Tate Modern London, the new forthcoming
Louvre-Lens (France), the Guggenheim-Hermitage in Vilnius (Lithuania) and the
Guggenheim Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) whose principal aim is the re-activation
(and/or the diversification) of the economy of their territories, in addition to the obvious
cultural aim. The effectiveness of a large heritage investment in developing a city
depends on at least four variables. First, heritage investments become effective
employment creators only to the extent that they become effective tourism magnets.
Second, the impact of investments on cultural heritage could be negative if
the heritage industry is a big portion of the whole economy. Third, the more the
redevelopment zone’s markets are integrated, the easier the absorption of price tensions
caused by urban revitalization. Fourth, the greater the productivity of the city’s economy,
the greater the absorption of price tensions. The aim of this essay is to give empirical
support to these hypotheses for the case of Bilbao and the Guggenheim Museum. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article investigates how state-sponsored ‘arts and cultural districts’ and
‘creative placemaking’ revitalization strategies affect urban neighborhoods, using the
Station North Arts &amp; Entertainment (A&amp;E) District in Baltimore, Maryland (USA) as a
case study. Through ethnographic participatory methods and 39 qualitative interviews, we
studied the activities and attitudes of various stakeholders within Station North. Since
its designation as an arts and entertainment district in 2002, a number of public–private
partnerships have helped increase home values in Station North, suggesting that the
‘branding’ of Station North has been successful. While the institutions involved in the
district, including community development corporations and local universities, are careful
to insist that they do not want to displace low-income residents, many interviewees
expressed concerns that these institutions exert influence outweighing that of longtime
residents. While a certain level of gentrification has occurred with the arrival of new
residents, we argue that the people who are most likely to be displaced from the arts and
entertainment district in the future are, paradoxically, artists, especially those who wish to
buy homes and settle in the district. After discussing the case of Station North, we consider
broader implications of the use of arts for urban revitalization. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Enhancing local democracy and empowering communities in decision-making are top
priorities of European political agendas. However, the abundance and heterogeneity of
existing examples of inclusive practices have provoked an ongoing debate on the
implications and outcomes that deliberation might generate under specific conditions.
Among these practices, urban regeneration is usually welcomed as a vehicle for
engaging communities in public decision-making; nevertheless, the specific participative
settings designed to implement those programs tend to generate peculiar communicative
dynamics, which can in turn lead to unexpected results. The specific manner in which
participation is set up by local governments does influence empowerment results. This
hypothesis is verified through a cross-case comparison of two neighbourhood
regeneration initiatives in Copenhagen and Milan. The empirical results show to what
extent issue-centred and structural models of participation differ in terms of the
institutional devices they adopt, the type of participants, the nature of the controversies
occurring, and the empowerment outcomes. Furthermore, participatory settings tend to
reproduce institutionalized practices of interaction between third-sector agencies,
voluntary associations and public authorities. Specifically, consolidated third-sector
regimes in Denmark and Italy tend to influence the devices that their local governments
adopt in order to engage local civil society. </td>

approach industrial heritage, usually considered a conservation issue, from a different
perspective, as a tool for individuation and socialization. In order to do this, we start by
describing the effects of capitalism and globalization on public open spaces, and then
link this to governments’ privatization policies for industrial heritage. We show how
industrial landscapes could function as public spaces. Finally, we explain how, in the
absence of other public open spaces, industrial landscapes could be used for public
purposes to meet the social needs of humans, and could thus be instrumental in the
proliferation of our rituals. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2013 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article investigates the ways in which cultural economy is formed through
negotiation and interaction between local actors in the case of culture-led regeneration
in Gwangju, South Korea. It looks at the dynamics between the bureaucrats’ pursuit of
economic growth in the city and the efforts of civil society to maintain a strong political
spirit throughout the regeneration process. Through in-depth interviews with various
participants and archival analysis, the politics of cultural economy are examined in
relation to the Gwangju Biennale and the City of Culture project. The findings show that
in these two cases bureaucrats were the dominant force, a tendency that instrumentalized
culture. They also illustrate that this dominance brought about resistance from civil
society. However, in the process of both engaging in conflict and working with each other,
the different discourses of economic growth and cultural meaning were integrated, and
in the process mutual learning and adaptation took place among members of the two
groups. Civil society also faced cleavages resulting from different approaches to how to
collaborate with the bureaucrats and its ensuing self-reflection on communicative value
enhanced its rehabilitation. The article argues that the politics of cultural economy is
dynamic, involving processes of renegotiation, adaptation and self-realization. It also
offers the possibility of a new arena for the public sphere. Civil society plays a critical
role in the integration of culture and economy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Despite the fact that much literature has focused on the centrality of heritage to urban
regeneration and economic restructuring in Western cities, heritage production has
remained largely absent from accounts of urban studies in the context of China. This
article addresses this neglect by examining the process of constructing an invented
heritage (Mu Palace) in Lijiang Old Town in China, and how town residents have
responded to this invented heritage. Drawing on a framework situated in urban
political economy and the cultural politics of heritage, this article analyzes the
local government’s role as the principal actor in integrating Mu Palace into locational
policies aimed at achieving urban competitiveness and reaping economic returns.
Simultaneously, the article asserts the dissonance in which local residents contest the
state’s efforts. It sheds light on local ruling elites’ entrepreneurship in mobilizing urban
heritage for economic growth and political control, and on how locational policies of
place-making are contested by ordinary people in China. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2011 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This study examines the changing role of the public sector in Turkey with regard to
housing provision since 1950, and particularly since 2000, and seeks to clarify how
public intervention has affected housing provision and urban development dynamics in
major cities. Three periods may be identified, with central government acting as a
regulator in a first period characterized by a ‘housing boom’. During the second period,
from 1980 to 2000, a new mass housing law spurred construction activity, although the
main beneficiaries of the housing fund tended to be the middle classes. After 2000,
contrary to emerging trends in both Northern and Southern European countries, the
public sector in Turkey became actively involved in housing provision. During this
process, new housing estates were created on greenfield sites on the outskirts of cities,
instead of efforts being made to rehabilitate, restore or renew existing housing stock in
the cities. Meanwhile, the concept of ‘urban regeneration’ has been opportunistically
incorporated into the planning agenda of the public sector, and — under the pretext of
regenerating squatter housing areas — existing residents have been moved out, while
channels for community participation have been bypassed. </td>

an index of neighborhood socioeconomic vitality.
The arbitrage model of neighborhood succession is
shown to be directly connected to neighborhood
property value appreciation trends. This model is
useful because it moves the discussion of neighborhood
transition beyond the “neighborhood life
cycle”-where neighborhoods always go from stable
to deteriorated-to a more general perspective
where, depending on the circumstances, neighborhoods
can be either upgraded or downgraded. It is
concluded that monitoring property value trends
may be helpful in the design of neighborhood revitalization
strategies, both for the direct information

Huge capital costs for land acquisition,

private investment begins. The four

subsidies to get started-although
a sophisticated redevelopment
agency could minimize the cash contributions

private developers was critical
to the survival of the redevelopment
authorities. Private investment was
dominated by the swings in the local
property market; a skilled agency
could ride the cycles and smooth out
the effects of booms and busts. Agencies
that inflated their plans during a

about overdevelopment of the waterfront

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Many American cities are experiencing
a rise in the number of residents in
their downtowns. This phenomenon
has deep roots but is extremely fragile.
Six approaches to developing downtown
housing dominate the arrangements.
The public and private sectors
have cooperated in many ways to attract
this type of investment. Downtown
housing, however, is only one
part of the larger puzzle of urban revitalization
and metropolitan growth.
Many questions regarding the nature
of downtown land uses, including the
relationship between housing and employment,
remain. This article presents
statistical evidence regarding downtown
housing for 45 cities and outlines
the approaches many have employed
to capture these housing units. It also demonstrates the difficulty of defining
a city’s downtown. </td>

Redevelopers: Planning Public Support for Urban Regeneration </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Peter B. Meyer, Thomas S. Lyons </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2000 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Municipal brownfield redevelopment
efforts have tended to assume that the
sites involved were economically noncompetitive.
They have thus focused
on public acquisition of contaminated
property and direct incentives to specific
on-site activities. The emergence
of a growing number of entrepreneurial
firms that redevelop brownfields—
often with minimal public involvement—
suggests limits to the efficacy of
this approach for large and very “dirty”
sites that continue to stand abandoned
to the frustration of local planners
and economic developers. New
approaches to public support for such
regeneration may be suggested by
closer examination of the private
brownfield entrepreneurs. This article
reports the results of a survey of these
developers, suggesting that planners
can contribute to more efficient use of
public economic development resources
by recognizing when public intervention
really contributes to, and
when it may inadvertently detract
from, the attractiveness of sites a community
wants to see regenerated. </td>

Rehabilitation Tax Credits and the Transformation of U.S. Cities </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Stephanie Ryberg-Webster </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2013 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Problem, research strategy, and findings:
Do historic rehabilitation tax credits (RTCs) play
a central force in ongoing urban revitalization? I
examine the role that federal RTCs have played in
transforming U.S. downtowns using a case study
approach and geocoded, longitudinal data for 10
cities: Atlanta (GA), Baltimore (MD), Cleveland
(OH), Denver (CO), Philadelphia (PA), Portland
(OR), Providence (RI), Richmond (VA), Seattle
(WA), and St. Louis (MO). I find intense
concentrations of downtown RTC investments in
these cities; these projects were relatively resilient
through the recent recession. Federal RTCs play
an important role in the ongoing, postindustrial
transformation of U.S. downtowns. RTC-funded
projects concentrate downtown and are a key
factor in the reinvestment of declining cities.
Takeaway for practice: Historic rehabilitation
tax credits are an important tool for
downtown revitalization efforts and will help
local planners and urban policymakers develop
robust strategies for downtown redevelopment.
Unfortunately, the RTC program cannot be used
for owner-occupied units, public schools, or
government buildings; there are a finite number
of eligible historic buildings; and planners have
little control over the location of RTC-supported
projects. Local planners, however, can facilitate
the use of RTC financing by removing regulatory
barriers to adaptive reuse and downtown
mixed-use development, being cautious when
considering demolishing older buildings, and
working with local preservation groups to
streamline the process. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> problem, research strategy, and
findings: The contentious politics of the
demolition of Lafi tte public housing in post-
Katrina New Orleans and its replacement
with mixed-income properties is a telling
case of the strategic confl icts housing
advocates face in public housing revitalization.
It reveals how the qualified outcomes
of HOPE VI interact with local institutional
and historical circumstances to confound
the equity and social justice goals of housing
and community development advocates. It
shows the limits to public housing revitalization
as an urban recovery strategy when
hostile government leadership characterizes
a region, and the state is recast as an adversary
rather than revitalization partner. This
case is part of a longer ethnographic project
on post-Katrina New Orleans recovery.
Takeaway for practice: Housing and
community development advocacy for
urban revitalization strategies is limited
without a supportive state partner to
endorse and smooth programmatic efforts.
Public housing revitalization, especially the
legacy and derivatives of HOPE VI, is
imbued with multiple, often conflicting
meanings and expectations across its range
of stakeholders. Nonprofit housing advocates
charged with integrating revitalization
schemes in communities with historic
government-civil society conflict can expect
resistance and challenges from both the state
and civil society actors. </td>

choice model identifying households’ willingness-to-pay for neighborhood quality. These willingness-to-pay
estimates are then compared to the actual price changes that accompany observed changes in neighborhood
quality. The results suggest that price increases associated with revitalization are smaller than
most households’ willingness-to-pay for neighborhood improvements. Conversely, declines in neighborhood
quality are generally not accompanied by rent declines sufficient to compensate the typical resident.
For the majority of the population, then, neighborhood revitalization is beneficial and decline
detrimental. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) provide supplemental services to urban commercial corridors
using funds from member assessments. They have become a very popular urban revitalization tool,
but their formation is still largely unexplained. Theory implies that BIDs will form if they add to aggregate
welfare and if the marginal net benefit of membership is positive. I test this for the neighborhood overall
and at the BID boundary. Using unique, micro-level and longitudinal data from New York City, I employ
survival analysis methods to estimate the likelihood of a neighborhood forming a BID. I then estimate the
likelihood of the marginal property’s BID membership by comparing the characteristics of properties
located immediately inside and outside of the BID boundaries. I find that BIDs are more likely to form
when there is more commercial space over which the BID benefits can be capitalized and when there
is homogeneity in service and spending preferences across properties. BIDs also tend to form in neighborhoods
that possess signs of appreciation and growth. Generally, BIDs are more likely to form in neighborhoods
with higher valued properties with the exception of very wealthy areas. The BID boundary,
however, is comprised of relatively less valuable properties. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In an era of data-driven smart cities, the possibility of using crowdsourced big data to support
evidence-based planning and decision-making remains a challenge. Along with the increased availability
and potential utility of crowdsourced data, there is a clear need to assess the validity of
these data in order to determine their appropriate use for planning and management. Moreover,
with growth and rapid urbanization in many cities, there are increasing challenges associated with
urban mobility. The goal of this research is to develop an understanding of the geographical
representativeness of crowdsourced data in the context of urban mobility through investigation
of bicycling in Australian cities. In order to leverage both the geographic distribution and high
volume of crowdsourced data for validity assessment, we present a two-stage statistical
approach. First, we evaluate flow data through correlation between spatial interaction matrices
in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. The second stage evaluates the quantity of information
available within the interaction matrices. The approach is demonstrated with crowdsourced bicycling commuting routes recorded by the RiderLog app from 2010 to 2014 that are
then correlated with census bicycling journey to work data. Data are from four of Australia’s
state capital cities: Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. These methods assess the representativeness
of individual bicycle routes that address the full pattern of flows within multiorigin
multidestination systems and incorporate spatial autocorrelation. Results indicate that these
crowdsourced data are geographically representative of regional travel where there are higher
data volumes, generally in central business districts and occasionally in outlying areas. This
research provides insights into both methods for statistical comparison of flow data and the
use of crowdsourced bicycling routes for urban planning and management. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The influence of urban design on economic vitality has been analyzed by a number of researchers and
is also a key focus of many planning/design theories. However, most quantitative studies are based on
just one city or a small set of cities, rather than a large number of cities that are representative of an
entire country. With the increasing availability of new data, we aim to alleviate this gap by examining
the impact of urban design upon economic vitality for the 286 largest cities in China by looking at a
grid of geographical units that are 1 km by 1 km.We use these units and a set of new data (emerging
big data and new data that reflecting urban developments and human mobility) to look at the impact
of urban form indicators, such as intersection density (urban design), level of mixed use, and access
to amenities and transportation, on economic vitality represented by activities using social media
data. Our results show that these urban design indicators have a significant and positive relationship
with levels of economic vitality for cities at every administrative level. The results contribute to a
holistic understanding of how to improve economic vitality in cities across China at a detailed level,
particularly at a time when China’s economic growth will depend largely on growth of the service
sector in urban areas. We think these results can help decision makers, developers, and planners/
designers to improve economic vitality in cities across China. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Statistics about citizen satisfaction regarding urban facilities and services are required for
governing urban areas. Such statistics are often unavailable or outdated. At times, existing
statistics are irrelevant to the major problems of most citizens. In this article, we propose a
cost-effective method for estimating citizen satisfaction regarding urban facilities and services
using crowdsourced place data. Two indicators are proposed based on place data derived from
the Foursquare social media application. Both indicators are based on the hypothesis that the
higher the number of places is that belong to a facility or service type on social media, then the
higher the satisfaction of citizens regarding this facility or service type will be. This hypothesis was
tested by using the Eurobarometer survey data as reference. The accuracy assessment revealed
strong and statistically significant linear relationships (R2 &gt; 0.6) between the reference
percentage of very satisfied citizens and some categories (i.e. ‘‘Sport facilities’’, ‘‘Cultural
Categories,’’ and ‘‘Streets &amp; buildings’’). Other categories showed moderate and statistically
significant linear relationships (i.e. ‘‘Public spaces’’ and ‘‘Green spaces’’). Therefore, the proposed
indicators provide estimates about citizen satisfaction with regard to these five categories. The
new indicators can be used to better design public opinion surveys by making them more relevant
to the public in terms of topics, space, and time. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gentrification, the rise of affluent socioeconomic populations in economically depressed urban
neighborhoods, has been accused of disrupting community in these neighborhoods. Social media
networks meanwhile have been recognized not only to create new communities in
neighborhoods, but are also associated with gentrification. What relation then does
gentrification and social media networks have to urban communities? To explore this question,
this study uses social media networks found on Twitter to identify communities in Washington,
DC. With space-time analysis of 821,095 geo-tagged tweets generated by 77,528 users captured
from 15 October 2015 to 18 July 2016, we create a location-based interaction measure of tweets
which overlays the social networks of the comprising users based on their followers and
followees. We identify gentrifying neighborhoods with the 2000 Census and the 2010–2014
American Community Survey at the block group level. We then compare the density of
location-based interactions between gentrifying and nongentrifying neighborhoods. We find
that gentrification is significantly related to these location-based interactions. This suggests that
gentrification indeed is associated with some communities in neighborhoods, though questions
remain as to who has access. Making novel use of big data, these results demonstrate the
important role built environment has on social connections forged ‘‘online.’’ </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The question of inferring the owner of a set of building stocks (e.g. from which country the
buildings are taken) from building-related quantities like number of buildings or types of building
event histories necessitates the knowledge of their distributions in order to compare them. If the
distribution function is a power law, then a version of the 80/20 rule can be applied to describe
the variable. This distribution is an example of a heavy-tailed distribution; another example is the
log-normal distribution. Heavy-tailed distributions have the property that studying the effects of
the few large values already yields most of the overall effect of the whole quantity. For example, if
reducing the CO2 emissions of the buildings of a country is the issue, then in case of a heavy-tailed
distribution, only the effects of the relatively few large cities need to be considered. It is shown
that the number of buildings in German municipalities or counties or the number of building related
event histories of a certain vanished building stock follow a heavy-tailed distribution and
give evidence for the type of underlying distribution. The methodology used is a recent statistical
framework for discerning power law and other heavy-tailed distributions in empirical data. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The purpose of this research is to examine relationships between occurrences of snatch-and-run
offences and hourly population estimated from mobile phone users’ locations, with particular
focus on differences between daytime and nighttime. Using an hourly population dataset allows us
to count the so-called ‘ambient population’ by hour of day to accurately quantify the influence of
such population as capable guardians and suitable targets in a framework of routine activity
theory. Our major findings based on logistic regression models are that (1) the effects of
ambient population and (2) its temporal change are large, and the effects differ between
daytime and nighttime. During the daytime, snatch-and-run offences are less likely to occur in
areas where hourly population density is expect to increase, possibly because offenders are highly
sensitive to the risk of being detected by other people. On the other hand, offences at night occur
even in relatively crowded areas, and they are only weakly related to population change.
In addition, our study found that (3) snatch-and-run offences are more likely to occur in or
near local town centres and (4) socially vulnerable neighbourhoods are only targeted at night.
We attempted to explain this in terms of offenders’ characteristics and motivations depending on
time of day. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The fact that accessibility shapes the geographic distribution of activity needs to be addressed in
any long-term policy and planning for urban systems. One major problem is that current accessibility
measures rely on the identification and quantification of attractions in the system. We
propose that it is possible to devise a network centrality measure that bypasses this reliance and
predicts the distribution of urban activity directly from the structure of the infrastructure networks
over which interactions take place. From a basis of spatial interaction modelling and
eigenvector centrality measures, we develop what we call a preferential centrality measure that
recursively and self-consistently integrates activity, attraction and accessibility. Derived from the
same logic as Google’s PageRank algorithm, we may describe its operation by drawing a parallel:
Google’s PageRank algorithm ranks the importance of networked documents without the need
to perform any analysis of their contents. Instead it considers the topological structure of the
network and piggybacks thereby on contextualised and deep evaluation of documents by the
myriad distributed agents that constructed the network. We do the same thing with regard to
networked geographical zones. Our approach opens up new applications of modelling and promises
to alleviate a host of recalcitrant problems, associated with integrated modelling, and the
need for large volumes of socio-economic data. We present an initial validation of our proposed
measure by using land taxation values in the Gothenburg municipality as an empirical proxy of
urban activity. The resulting measure shows a promising correlation with the taxation values. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Land-use change models that accurately replicate the complex dynamics of land development
provide vital information for urban planning and policy. These models require both detailed data
and advanced statistical methods. Many factors influence land-use change decisions, such as parcel
characteristics, accessibility to activities, and current and historical neighborhood conditions.
Therefore, spatial and temporal components must be incorporated in a model at the highest
possible disaggregation level in order to achieve robust results. A spatio-temporal multinomial
autologistic model, incorporating space and time and their interactions, is introduced to
investigate land-use dynamics at the parcel-level, and is applied to Delaware County, Ohio. It is
able to capture the impacts of the existing and historical neighborhood conditions of parcels with
high accuracy. Advanced computational methods are used to deal with the computational
challenges of parameter estimation. The model is validated, estimating 91.4% of all
observations correctly for the period 2005–2010, and is applied to land-use forecasting. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Geographic space is better understood through the topological relationship of the underlying
streets (note: entire streets rather than street segments), which enables us to see scaling or
fractal or living structure of far more less-connected streets than well-connected ones. It is this
underlying scaling structure that makes human activities predictable, albeit in the sense of
collective rather than individual human moving behavior. This topological analysis has not yet
received its deserved attention in the literature, as many researchers continue to rely on segment
analysis for predicting human activities. The segment analysis-based methods are essentially
geometric, with a focus on geometric details of locations, lengths, and directions, and are
unable to reveal the scaling property, which means they cannot be used for the prediction of
human activities. We conducted a series of case studies using London streets and tweet location
data, based on related concepts such as natural streets, and natural street segments (or street
segments for short), axial lines, and axial line segments (or line segments for short). We found
that natural streets are the best representation in terms of human activities or traffic prediction,
followed by axial lines, and that neither street segments nor line segments bear a good correlation
between network parameters and tweet locations. These findings point to the fact that the reason
why space syntax based on axial lines, or the kind of topological analysis in general, works has
little to do with individual human travel behavior or ways that humans conceptualize distances or
spaces. Instead, it is the underlying scaling hierarchy of streets – numerous least-connected, a very
few most-connected, and some in between the least- and most-connected – that makes human
activities predictable. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2017 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In light of the urgent threats presented by climate change and rapid urbanisation, interest in ‘smart
city systems’ is mounting. In contrast to scholarship that poses ‘smartness’ as something that
needs to be added to cities, recent developments in spatial morphology research pursue a view of
the built fabric of cities as an extension of the cognitive human apparatus, as well as a material
formulation of social, cultural and economic relations and processes. The built fabric of cities
needs to be understood as a highly intelligent artefact in itself, rather than simple, dead matter.
The current focus on high-tech systems risks concealing the fact that the machine is already there.
In contrast to the technological ‘implements’ of smart city systems, this article looks at cities as
‘facilities’ – that is, as technologies that slow down, store and maintain energy as a resource for a
variety of purposes. The article builds on space syntax research in order to give precision to the
understanding of the affordances the cities offer their various processes and the ways in which
cities operate as information storage and retrieval devices for individuals and for society. The city
must be considered, we argue, in terms of a range of tangled, interdependent systems, reaching
from individual buildings to the whole city, an understanding anchored in notions of ‘diversity’ and
‘density’ (recently gathered under the concept of ‘spatial capital’) and in research addressing how
the distribution of space and artefacts serve as means of knowledge communication (specifically,
in complex buildings such as libraries and department stores). In conclusion, we argue that
existing discussions on ‘smart city systems’ would benefit acknowledgement of the role of
cities as facilities. </td>

automate this data collection process. To answer this question, our team embedded sensors in
moveable benches and evaluated their performance according to the Gehl Method, a popular
guideline that measures public life. During three field tests, we gathered information on public life
via several sensors including image capture, location tracking, weight measurement, and other
environmental sensing techniques. Ultimately, we determined that analysis derived from image
processing was the most effective method for measuring public life. Our research demonstrates
that it is possible to use sensors to automate the measurement of public life and highlights the
value and precision of using video footage for collecting these data. Since image processing
algorithms have become more accessible and can be applied to Do-it-Yourself projects, future
work can build on this research to develop open access image processing tools to evaluate and
advocate for urban design strategies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This article investigates the design and evolution of smart city platforms in the global south using
the Indonesian cities of Jakarta and Surabaya as case studies. While smart city projects are often
framed in generic rhetoric of efficiency and modernization, the concept was originally formulated
for cities in developed countries, and therefore requires adjustment for the local conditions in
the developing world. While the former can rely on established institutions and well-developed
infrastructures, the latter are characterized by rapid urbanization, weaker institutions, a lack of
resources and public services. Unlike their highly regulated counterparts, cities in the global south
are shaped by a dynamic informal economy and practices of improvisation. Using the lens of
organizational improvisation, this article investigates how urban platforms emerge, and how they
adapt to improvisational practices in the administration and the urban population. The article
investigates different types of urban data platforms and their relationship with the social practices
of their users. With Indonesian Smart City initiatives in Jakarta and Surabaya as a case study, this
article aims to identify the local needs that motivated these cities to develop their respective
projects. The second question asks how smart city implementations respond and adapt to the
specific local conditions and the improvisational practices of their users. Distinguishing three
types of urban data platforms, the article characterizes specific processes of bricolage and argues
for stronger consideration of processes of improvisation in the design of urban data platforms.
The contribution is threefold. The article provides a framework based on improvisation and
bricolage that allows the social dynamics around smart city platforms and their impact on the
system to be differentiated. It provides lessons on how traditional smart city models need to be
adapted for cities in emerging economies. Finally, it offers a critique of the platform metaphors
that are normally taken for granted. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Despite several calls in this journal of debating the rapid growth of the literature on ‘‘smart cities’’,
such a debate has in large been absent. Smart cities are often un-critically launched as a sustainable
way of developing cities. When cities become increasingly complex as its features are wired into
the Internet, theories for their understanding is lagging behind. As it is prospected that a greater
number of people and things will become connected by Information and Computer Technology,
the complexity of urban systems will over time increase. Historical insights reveal that as
complexity in societies increase, growth in energy consumption tends to follow. In this paper,
we discuss whether complexity carried too far could lead to diminishing returns of energy saving
and create unmanageable urban systems. As part of initiating such a debate, this commentary asks
whether the smart cities development has a bearing on the issue whether a society can erode its
capacity of sustaining itself? We pose this question against the backdrop that no one actually
knows what type of society the smart cities model in the end will generate. </td>

The strategy is aimed at evaluating and then promoting

planning framework, suggesting ways to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of places in relative
terms, taking into account how different kinds of nodes - from light rail stops to parking lots - varying with respect to sustainable urban form characteristics. Overlaying data on accessibility,

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper presents the early results of a study aimed at experimenting an innovative approach to
the design and the evaluation of complex urban transformation processes, based on the combined
use of different design strategies and tools. The purpose of the paper is to illustrate, by means of a
case study, a multi-level decision aiding process, able to support strategic urban design, with
specific reference to regeneration processes for abandoned industrial sites in urban areas. The
case study presented in the paper concerns different alternative proposals for the requalification
of the former Shougang/Er-Tong mechanical factory in Beijing, China. The choice of a Chinese case
study as a field test for an experimentation about mixed methods research approaches in the
domain of urban transformation is related to the peculiar emerging conditions of that context, in
which huge economic potentials are speeding up the transformation but a substantial lack of
cultural and methodological instruments to manage a so fast modification exists. During the
design process, three methods in particular have been combined according to a multi-phase
design: (i) Stakeholders Analysis, (ii) Multicriteria Analysis, and (iii) Discounted Cash Flow
Analysis. Each one of them has been applied in parallel to the evolution of the different design
scenarios. The results of the performed study show that mixed methods approaches are a
promising line of research in the field of environmental evaluation and urban design. Insights
and guidelines for the replication of the proposed methodological approach in other territorial

of a questionnaire and interviews. Data on public perception of post-industrial landscape that
incorporates significant environmental, cultural and historic assets were collected from 450
residents. Results illustrate that community attitudes to brownfield regeneration projects are
positive. Urban growth should consider the redevelopment of derelict and/or abandoned areas
instead of consuming new green areas. The results illustrated that, according to public perception,
the most important aspect in the redevelopment of the study area is the creation of
multifunctional areas, and that this aspect is statistically related with touristic activities, mobility
and accessibility, use of renewable energies, environmental education, economic redevelopment,
and safety/security. The researchers suggest that coupling the information gathered throughout
the public preference process with the intrinsic characteristics of each landscape is helpful in
understanding community expectations in order to inform urban regeneration projects that

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In this paper I will report on the development of a new spatial understanding support
system (SUSS) for representing community disputes. It is argued that the more traditional approach
of spatial decision support systems (SDSS) has had limited success in its application to actual
community conflicts. In this study I have therefore adopted an alternative approach to spatial
decision support, broadly following the paradigm of soft operational research. A prototype system
termed CRANES (coordinator for rational arguments through nested substantiation) has been devel-
oped based on this alternative approach, integrated with a GIS. CRANES is a computer-assisted
communication tool that aims to structure conflicts with their geographical, strategic, and argumentative dimensions. In the case study CRANES was introduced into an actual consultation exercise on
an urban regeneration scheme in London. Results show that the multidimensional representation
realised by CRANES contributed to a richer understanding of other peoples' arguments. Furthermore
these arguments structured by and stored in CRANES proved to be a useful public resource for future
decisionmaking. It is concluded that SUSS such as CRANES could be incorporated into a future
consultation process for many real-world community conflicts. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Making realistic predictions about the occurrence of crime is a challenging
research area. City-wide crime patterns depend on the behaviour and interactions of
a huge number of people (including victims, offenders, and passers-by) as well as a
multitude of environmental factors. Modern criminology theory has highlighted the
individual-level nature of crime—whereby overall crime rates emerge from individual
crimes that are committed by individual people in individual places—but traditional
modelling methodologies struggle to capture the complex dynamics of the system. The
decision whether or not to commit a burglary, for example, is based on a person’s unique
behavioural circumstances and the immediate surrounding environment. To address
these problems, individual-level simulation techniques such as agent-based modelling
have begun to spread to the field of criminology. These models simulate the behaviour
of individual people and objects directly; virtual ‘agents’ are placed in an environment
that allows them to travel through space and time, behaving as they would do in the
real world. We outline an advanced agent-based model that can be used to simulate
occurrences of residential burglary at an individual level. The behaviour within the model
closely represents criminology theory and uses real-world data from the city of Leeds, UK
as an input. We demonstrate the use of the model to predict the effects of a real urban
regeneration scheme on local households. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Operational motorway conditions can be improved by introducing traffic flow
management and control systems, such as ramp metering (RM), high occupancy vehicle
(HOV) lanes, real-time variable speed limits (VSLs), reversible lanes (RL), automated highway
systems (AHS) and hard-shoulder running (HSR). The effects of such devices need to
be examined in terms of capacity and safety. This paper examines the case study of the
Italian motorway A22, which is supposed to be equipped with an HSR system implemented
along 128 km in order to reduce congestion with consequent improvement in levels of
service (LOS). We studied the traffic processes (capacity, flow distribution between lanes,
reliability, etc.) and estimated the expected capacity and safety conditions. These latter
were studied with the method provided by the Highway Safety Manual (HSM), as well
as by undertaking sensitivity analyses to quantify the expected changes in crash frequency
at varying HSR activation hours (from 30 to 200 h) in a year. It has been observed that HSR
activation does not involve significant variations in the general safety conditions in the
presence of a considerable capacity increase up to 35%. Moreover, have been identified
the cases which require speed limit implementation (with VSLs system) in function of
the values of reliability / and velocity process V, and also suggested a speed limit sign
system. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Signalized diamond interchanges (SDI), connecting major highways and surface streets in
urban and suburban areas, are probably the most widely used interchange patterns. The
limited storage space between the two closely joined intersections coupled with heavy
traffic volumes may easily oversaturate the facility and cause spillback problems, especially
with the presence of frontage roads. This paper presents an innovative design and
operational model for SDI by dynamically reversing certain lanes in the internal link on
a regular basis with the deployment of overhead reversible lane control signs. A Binary-
Mixed-Integer-Linear-Program (BMILP) is formulated to simultaneously optimize lane
markings, dynamic usage of the reversible lane, and signal timings for the new SDI system.
Results from extensive numerical analyses reveal the promising property of the proposed
design and operational model in expanding capacity and reducing congestion at the SDI
with frontage roads. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Intersections are hazardous places. Threats arise from interactions among pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles, more complicated vehicle trajectories
in the absence of lane markings, phases that prevent determining who has the right of way, invisible vehicle approaches, vehicle obstructions, and
illegal movements. These challenges are not fully addressed by the “road diet” and road redesign prescribed in Vision Zero plans, nor will they be
completely overcome by autonomous vehicles with their many sensors and tireless attention to surroundings. Accidents can also occur because
drivers, cyclists and pedestrians do not have the information they need to avoid wrong decisions. In these cases, the missing information can be
computed and broadcast by an intelligent intersection. The information gives the current full signal phase, an estimate of the time when the phase
will change, and the occupancy of the blind spots of the driver or autonomous vehicle. The paper develops a design of the intelligent intersection,
motivated by the analysis of an accident at an intersection in Tempe, AZ, between an automated Uber Volvo and a manual Honda CRV and
culminates in a proposal for an intelligent intersection infrastructure. The intelligent intersection also serves as a software-enabled version of the
‘protected intersection’ design to improve the passage of cyclists and pedestrians through an intersection. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The present study focuses on the development of a model for the optimal design of a road
diet plan within a transportation network, and is based on rigorous mathematical models.
In most metropolitan areas, there is insufficient road space to dedicate a portion exclusively
for cyclists without negatively affecting existing motorists. Thus, it is crucial to find
an efficient way to implement a road diet plan that both maximizes the utility for cyclists
and minimizes the negative effect on motorists. A network design problem (NDP), which is
usually used to find the best option for providing extra road capacity, is adapted here to
derive the best solution for limiting road capacity. The resultant NDP for a road diet
(NDPRD) takes a bi-level form. The upper-level problem of the NDPRD is established as
one of multi-objective optimization. The lower-level problem accommodates user equilibrium
(UE) trip assignment with fixed and variable mode-shares. For the fixed mode-share
model, the upper-level problem minimizes the total travel time of both cyclists and motorists.
For the variable mode-share model, the upper-level problem includes minimization of
both the automobile travel share and the average travel time per unit distance for motorists
who keep using automobiles after the implementation of a road diet. A multi-objective
genetic algorithm (MOGA) is mobilized to solve the proposed problem. The results of a case
study, based on a test network, guarantee a robust approximate Pareto optimal front. The
possibility that the proposed methodology could be adopted in the design of a road diet
plan in a real transportation network is confirmed. </td>

Both steps are based on ‘wall representations’ of the solutions. These representations allow geometric relations and operations to be transformed into relations and operations defined on character strings. They furthermore allow the (possibly infinite) set of solutions to be systematically searched for a finite set of ‘principal options’. The importance of linear-programming techniques for step 2 is described. </td>

a process which enables individual families to fine tune layouts of their small
unfinished flat--'shells'-- to fit their specific needs. The comparison of 'Tenant Fitout'
patterns was conducted to provide useful insights into the spatial and activity needs of
families as these insights can be extremely helpful in developing new shell designs. Also
discussed are the advantages of 'flexibility of shells' to accommodate several layout
options. The paper suggests that, because of the many advantages of 'Tenent Fitout',
the recent trend in Hong Kong towards building 'fixed layout' fiats instead of 'Shells

   <td style="text-align:left;"> World Heritage Landscapes (WHLs) are receiving increased attention from researchers, urban planners,
managers, and policy makers and many heritage values and resources are becoming irreversibly lost. This
phenomenon is especially prominent for WHLs located in cities, where greater development opportunities
are involved. Decision making for sustainable urban landscape planning, conservation and management
of WHLs often takes place from an economic perspective, especially in developing countries.
This, together with the uncertain source of funding to cover WHL operating and maintenance costs, has
resulted in many urban managers seeking private sector funding either in the form of visitor access fees
or leasing part of the site for high-rental facilities such as five star hotels, clubs and expensive restaurants.
For the former, this can result in low-income urban citizens being unable to afford the access fees
and hence contradicting the principle of equal access for all; while, for the latter, the principle of open
access for all is equally violated. To resolve this conflict, a game model is developed to determine how
urban managers should allocate WHL spaces to maximize the combination of economic, social and
ecological benefits and cultural values. A case study is provided of the Hangzhou'sWest Lake Scenic Area,
a WHL located at the centre of Hangzhou city, in which several high-rental facilities have recently been
closed down by the local authorities due to charges of elitism and misuse of public funds by government
officials. The result shows that the best solution is to lease a small space with high rents and leave the
remainder of the site to the public. This solution is likely to be applicable only in cities with a strong
economy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The urban heat island effect is especially significant in semi-arid climates, generating a myriad of problems for
large urban areas. Green space can mitigate warming, providing cooling benefits important to reducing energy
consumption and improving human health. The arrangement of green space to reap the full potential of cooling
benefits is a challenge, especially considering the diurnal variations of urban heat island effects. Surprisingly,
methods that support the strategic placement of green space in the context of urban heat island are lacking.
Integrating geographic information systems, remote sensing, spatial statistics and spatial optimization, we
developed a framework to identify the best locations and configuration of new green space with respect to
cooling benefits. The developed multi-objective model is applied to evaluate the diurnal cooling trade-offs in
Phoenix, Arizona. As a result of optimal green space placement, significant cooling potentials can be achieved. A reduction of land surface temperature of approximately 1–2 °C locally and 0.5 °C regionally can be achieved by the addition of new green space. 96% of potential day and night cooling benefits can be achieved through simultaneous consideration. The results also demonstrate that clustered green space enhances local cooling because of the agglomeration effect; whereas, dispersed patterns lead to greater overall regional cooling. The optimization based framework can effectively inform planning decisions with regard to green space allocation to best ameliorate excessive heat. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This study focuses on three groups: cyclists, non-cyclists, and non-car owners and examines the significance of the
perceived cycling environment, current travel behavior, urban form and socio-demographic variables for the
respondents' attitudes towards future cycling and car purchasing. The paper uses survey data (N ¼ 1427) collected
in eight Beijing neighborhoods. The analysis is carried out by means of principal component analysis and
multinomial logistic regression analysis. The respondents were generally more positive towards continuing
cycling or cycling more in the future than towards car purchasing. The perceived cycling environment was found
to be associated with respondents' attitude towards future cycling and car purchasing. The higher the level of
satisfaction with the clarity of cycling space allocation and the higher the agreement with pro-cycling policies, the
higher the probability that the respondents will cycle in the future and the lower probability that they will buy a
car. Associations with current travel behavior indicate that long everyday travel distances (e.g. 10 km to work or
longer) negatively affects the respondents attitude towards their future cycling, whereas short everyday travel
distances up to 2 km are positively linked to future cycling prospects. Non-car owners' attitude to future car
ownership is strongly linked to socio-demographic status - low education and low income level groups seems to be
most unlikely to take up driving in the future. To encourage people to cycle more and drive less, policy should
direct efforts to promoting the clarity of cycling space on the street and strengthen pro-cycling policies. Attention
should also be given to stabilizing the current travel modes of non-car users, including promoting the image of
cycling, improving the service of walking, cycling, public transport and generally by introducing attractive alternatives
to private car ownership. </td>

bicycles have all contributed to pressure on available space and conflicts over the allocation of space. This paper provides the first assessment of urban transport infrastructure space distribution,
distinguishing motorized individual transport, public transport,
cycling and walking. To calculate area allocation, an assessment
methodology was developed using high-resolution digital satellite
images in combination with a geographical information system to
derive area measurements. This methodology was applied to four
distinctly different city quarters in Freiburg, Germany. Results
indicate that space is unevenly distributed, with motorized
individual transport being the favoured transport mode. Findings
also show that if trip number to space allocation ratios are
calculated, one of the most sustainable transport modes, the
bicycle, is the most disadvantaged. This suggests that area
allocation deserves greater attention in the planning and
implementation of more sustainable urban transport designs. </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2019 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Travel demand management (TDM) is an important measure that will aid in the realization
of efficient and sustainable transportation systems. However, in cities where the most
serious traffic congestion occurs, implementation of a single TDM measure might not be
enough to reduce congestion, because the congestion mechanism in this case is highly
complex and involves different transportation modes interacting with each other. Implementation
of multiple TDM measures has rarely been discussed in the literature. Therefore,
in this study, we propose a simulation-based joint optimization framework composed of
dedicated bus lanes and vehicular congestion pricing. The objective of the optimization
process is to minimize the congestion cost based on an advanced macroscopic flow theory
called the multimodal macroscopic fundamental diagram (mMFD), which can capture
the macroscopic traffic dynamics of multimodal transportation systems. In the proposed
framework, we develop mMFD-based congestion pricing scheme and incorporate traveler’s
behavioral model (i.e. joint departure time and mode choices) with the microscopic traffic
simulator. We consider the Tokyo central area as a case study. The simulation results indicate
that space allocation of 4.7% for the dedicated bus lanes would be optimal for Tokyo’s
network, while the optimal congestion pricing scheme indicates that charges of 900 JPY
between 7:30 and 8:00 AM and 300 JPY between 8.00 and 8:30 AM should be levied. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In this study we present an on-street parking model for downtowns in urban centers that
incorporates the often-neglected delivery demand of delivery trucks. The behavior of truck
deliveries is distinctly different from commuter parking: trucks do not cruise for parking
spaces, and demand for goods delivery is driven by customers and is practically inelastic
to the delivery costs. We generalize the downtown on-street parking model from Arnott
and Inci (2006) to study the relationship between passenger vehicles’ parking and truck
delivery behaviors, and provide tools for policy makers to optimize the trade-offs in parking
space allocation, pricing, and aggregate network congestion. The social optimum can be
obtained by solving a nonlinear optimization problem. The parking model is able to replicate
the commuter-only scenario as a special case. It is shown that ignoring truck delivery
behavior can significantly overestimate travel speeds and cruising stock. We applied the
model to a case study of downtown Toronto and found that compared to a baseline scenario
representative of Toronto in 2015, increasing parking fees from CAD $4/h to nearly
CAD $7.85/h and assigning 4.1% of parking spaces to truck deliveries would eliminate cruising
and truck double-parking, resulting in a social surplus gain of over CAD $14,304/h/
mile2. In a first-best allocation scenario where total parking spaces can also change, we
found that increasing total parking spaces by 18%, having 3.5% truck delivery allocation,
and reducing parking fees to CAD $2.47/h would eliminate cruising and double-parking
while increasing social surplus by CAD $24,883/h/mile2. These model findings are along
the same level of effect as demonstrated in the literature. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This study examined the changes in the media coverage of two road pricing schemes proposed
in the Netherlands in the period 1998–2010, as well as the link between the media
coverage and the policy debate. Both pricing proposals were debated for several years and
neither was introduced. Our findings show that space allocation for type of overall tone
(e.g. negative or positive towards a pricing proposal) and the range of issues and policy
actors in the media coverage were very different for the two proposals, and for each proposal
fluctuated greatly over time. Our analysis suggests that such a variation in the media
coverage was a reflection of changes in the content of the policy debate (e.g. caused by the
specific design features of pricing proposal under discussion, the different policy actors
engaged in the debate and their messages about the proposal). This indicates that policymakers
can influence the media coverage of road pricing policies to some extent by managing
the policy debate. Our findings also show not only that changes in the content of the
policy debate were reflected in the media coverage, but also that the media coverage influenced
the policy debate: the statements or actions of policy actors received media coverage,
which then in turn stimulated the policy debate. However, the influence of media on
the policy debate was rather indirect, in that policy actors mostly reacted to the messages
from other policy actors reported in the media and to a lesser extent to the media coverage
itself. </td>

research question. Quantifying the impact of road space distribution on the performance of
a congested multimodal transport system with a dynamic aggregated model remains a
challenge. In this paper, a multimodal macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) is developed
to represent the traffic dynamics of a multimodal transport system. Optimization is
performed with the objective of minimizing the total passenger hours traveled (PHT) to
serve the total demand by redistributing road space among modes. Pricing strategies are
also investigated to provide a higher demand shift to more efficient modes. We find by
an application to a bi-modal two-region city that (i) the proposed model captures the operational
characteristics of each mode, and (ii) optimal dynamic space distribution strategies
can be developed. In practice, the approach can serve as a physical dynamic model to
inform space distribution strategies for policy makers with different goals of mobility. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper focuses on the determination of optimal space allocation and optimal pricing for priority
systems in container ports. The problem is formulated taking into account the intrinsic and logistic cargo
value, and a capacity constraint that considers the various physical requirements of the containers. Prices
and space allocations are found for various cases, showing explicitly the role of each element. The resulting
models extend classical price dierentiation theory, i.e. the inverse elasticity rule, in various directions.
Finally, the implications of these results and the corresponding information requirements are clearly
established. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Container terminals are essential intermodal interfaces in the global transportation network. Efficient
container handling at terminals is important in reducing transportation costs and keeping shipping
schedules. In this paper, we study the storage space allocation problem in the storage yards of terminals.
This problem is related to all the resources in terminal operations, including quay cranes, yard cranes,
storage space, and internal trucks. We solve the problem using a rolling-horizon approach. For each
planning horizon, the problem is decomposed into two levels and each level is formulated as a mathematical
programming model. At the first level, the total number of containers to be placed in each storage block in
each time period of the planning horizon is set to balance two types of workloads among blocks. The
second level determines the number of containers associated with each vessel that constitutes the total
number of containers in each block in each period, in order to minimize the total distance to transport the
containers between their storage blocks and the vessel berthing locations. Numerical runs show that with
short computation time the method significantly reduces the workload imbalance in the yard, avoiding
possible bottlenecks in terminal operations. </td>

making. The cost model consists of the space cost, the investment cost of transfer cranes, and the operating
cost of transfer cranes and trucks. Two different cases are treated, one where the cost of only the terminal
operator is minimized, and another where the total cost of both the terminal operator and the customers is
minimized. For the former case, a deterministic model is developed, while for the latter case, a stochastic

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A smart design of transport systems involves efficient use and allocation of the limited urban road
capacity in the multimodal environment. This paper intends to understand the system-wide effect
of dividing the road space to the private and public transport modes and how the public transport
service provider responds to the space changes. To this end, the bimodal dynamic user equilibrium
is formulated for separated road space. The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD)
model is employed to depict the dynamics of the automobile traffic for its state-dependent feature,
its inclusion of hypercongestion, and its advantage of capturing network topology. The
delay of a bus trip depends on the running speed which is in turn affected by bus lane capacity
and ridership. Within the proposed bimodal framework, the steady-state equilibrium traffic
characteristics and the optimal bus fare and service frequency are analytically derived. The
counter-intuitive properties of traffic condition, modal split, and behavior of bus operator in the
hypercongestion are identified. To understand the interaction between the transport authority
(for system benefit maximization) and the bus operator (for its own benefit maximization), we
examine how the bus operator responds to space changes and how the system benefit is influenced
with the road space allocation. With responsive bus service, the condition, under which
expanding bus lane capacity is beneficial to the system as a whole, has been analytically established.
Then the model is applied to the dynamic framework where the space allocation
changes with varying demand and demand-responsive bus service. We compare the optimal bus
services under different economic objectives, evaluate the system performance of the bimodal
network, and explore the dynamic space allocation strategy for the sake of social welfare maximization. </td>

discrete event simulation and integrated into mix integer programming model. Empirical approaches
are developed to achieve a trade-off between fast computation and good solutions. The

develop a novel MIP formulation which can avoid generating scattered small fields. We then

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2001 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A study was undertaken to measure and estimate summertime air temperatures in suburban Tokyo, Japan. Air temperatures
were measured at a standard height of 1.5 m along streets in residential areas. Transects were run on two types of streets: those
that opened onto a paddy field, and those that did not. Streets opening onto a paddy field, and aligned so the wind moved
directly from the paddy field down the street, experienced lower air temperatures to a distance of approximately 150 m into the
neighborhood. Streets that did not open onto a paddy field, and ran normal to the wind direction, experienced no measured
temperature differences.
These measurements were compared with the air temperature distribution predicted by a simple internal boundary layer
(IBL) model based on advective effects resulting from air movement over a change in underlying surface. The IBL model was
able to accurately estimate the air temperatures in all situations, with regression coeficients for areas adjacent to large paddy
fields of r2  0:93, and for areas adjacent to small paddy fields of r2  0:83. Standard error of estimate (S.E.E.) values were
low at S:E:E:  0:21±0.248C for large paddy fields, and S:E:E:  0:23 C for small paddies.
Further work will be needed to test the relationship in other seasons, other climatic situations, and other urban settings.
However, these results suggest that there is potential for use of the IBL model in predicting the effects of planning and design
decisions on air temperature distribution in urban areas. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper evaluates strategies for operating buses on signal-controlled arterials using special lanes that are made intermittently
available to general traffic. The advantage of special bus lanes, intermittent or dedicated, is that they free buses
from traffic interference; the disadvantage is that they disrupt traffic.
We find that bus lanes with intermittent priority (BLIPs), unlike dedicated ones, do not significantly reduce street capacity.
Intermittence, however, increases the average traffic density at which the demand is served, and as a result increases
traffic delay. These delays are more than offset by the benefits to bus passengers as long as traffic demand does not exceed
by much the maximum flow possible on the non-special lanes; the smaller the excess the better. BLIPs are not intended for
roadways nearing or in excess of capacity.
The main factors determining whether an intermittent system saves time are: the traffic saturation level; the bus frequency; the improvement in bus travel time achieved by the special lane; and the ratio of bus and car occupant flows. In some scenarios where a dedicated bus lane could not be operated, a BLIP can save to bus and car occupants together
as much as 20 persons-min of travel per bus-km. The required conditions for this to happen are quite particular. Typical savings are smaller. Formulae are given. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Intermittent Bus Lane (IBL) used for bus priority is a lane in which the status of a given section changes
according to the presence or not of a bus in its spatial domain: when a bus is approaching such a section,
the status of that lane is changed to BUS lane, and after the bus moves out of the section, it becomes a
normal lane again, open to general traffic. Therefore when bus services are not so frequent, general traffic
will not suffer much, and bus priority can still be obtained. This measure can be operating at a single city
block, but if all related control parameters along bus lines are considered together, more time gains can be
obtained. In this paper, the basic structure and operation of IBL around a single intersection are briefly
introduced, then the construction of an objective function and its relationships with the related priority
control parameters along one bus line and their simplifications are described. Finally the calculations of
the priority control parameters when there are several connected bus lines within an area and some simulation
results are discussed. </td>
