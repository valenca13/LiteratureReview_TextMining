Unveiling the inter-relations between the urban streets network and its dynamic traffic flows: Planning implication



Abstract
Traffic flows have always been a major element affecting the nature of urban  streets. Traffic flows
influence the location  of businesses, residences, and the development of real  estate, land values,
and built-density. In this  study, we suggest that  revealing the relations  between the  static  street
network   and dynamic  traffic  flows  may  provide  meaningful and  useful  insights that  could  be
applied in  planning processes. Thus, the  objective  of  this  work  is  to  unveil the  inter-relations
between the  dynamics of traffic  flows and urban  street networks   in different  areas of a city  and
between cities.  We  use network   percolation  analysis (i.e., removal of  links  with  a speed value
lower  than  a  pre-defined  threshold)   to  develop  an  innovative  method  to   identify  functional
spatio-temporal  street  clusters that  represent  fluent  traffic flow.  We  employed our  method  on
two data sets of London  and Tel Aviv centers and analyzed the dynamics of these clusters, based
on their  size (in terms of street  length) and their  spatial stability over time.  Our  findings revealed
both  the  differences  between  the  two   cities  as well   as differences  and  similarities  between
different  areas within   each  city.  Thus, our   method   can be  used  to  develop  new,  real-time,
decision-making tools  for  urban  and transportation   planners. Today, new technologies  provide
big data on urban traffic  flow,  which can be used in  developing new, adaptive tools  for  planning.
However,  urban   and  transportation    planning   are  currently    being  challenged  by  real-time

navigation apps that aim to find the fastest routes for their users. To be able to intervene and
affect urban life quality, planners should adopt new tools that are based on real-time, short-term
approaches. These will bridge the gap between static long-term urban planning and the flexible
and dynamic urban rhythm, and will enable planners to keep their role in the formation of
better cities.

Introduction

The interdependencies between urban planning, and in particular land-use planning, and
urban traffic  have been widely discussed in the literature (Banister, 2005; Giuliano, 2004;
Jiang, 2009; Manheim, 1979; Meurs, 2002; Wegener and Fu¨rst, 2004). Traffic systems are
being used for movement between different urban functions and locations, while land-use
generates the map of origins and destinations for  urban movement (Hillier,  1996, 2002).
Human activities are mainly  shaped by the underlying  street network (Ma  et  al., 2019).
On the other hand, human mobility  within  cities affects the level of exposure of different
locations, which can be leveraged as a growth generator for businesses and alter land use.
The circular  causality between urban traffic  and urban  development is one of  the most
significant factors in  current  traffic  planning.  However, in  order  to  achieve sustainable
and efficient urban  mobility  patterns, the integration  between urban and  transportation
planning must be improved (Banister, 2005; Cervero, 1998).
    Traffic availability  is a major  factor in  location decision-making of different  land uses,
and an important  factor in  the variations  of real estate values. This hypothesis has been
tested and proven widely (Fang et al., 2017; Ibeas et al. 2012;Mills, 1967; Von Thu¨nen and
Hall, 1966; Waddell et al., 2007). Today, there is extensive literature regarding the connection 
between the physical structure of  the street network and the  traffic movement on it
(Bailenson et al., 2000; Crane, 2000; Hillier, 1996, 2002; Penn, 2003). However, this body of
work refers to the urban system as static, while in reality, the traffic movement network is
dynamic. This is true when referring  to different  time-scales such as hours during a day,
different days of the week, and even different months of the year.
    Traditionally,  planners used transportation  planning  to  influence the nature  and the
characteristics of different areas in the city. While high streets were characterized by wide
roads and commerce/service land use, residential neighborhoods had been planned with side
streets that were designed to hold  the volume of  transportation  of  their  residents only.
This was used as a route choice strategy by drivers who relied on a primary network  for
their navigation (Kuipers  et al., 2003; Pailhous, 1984). New navigation apps (e.g., Waze,
Google Directions) change the way people use urban roads as they are being directed to
residential streets in order to avoid traffic congestion. These apps do not integrate consid-
erations concerning public well-being or the quality  of urban  life in  their algorithms  and
they are  motivated  only  by  their  objective  to  minimize  the  duration  of  the  journey.
This  changes the  nature  of   neighborhoods and  disturbs  the   life  of   their  residents.
Thus, the penetration of  real-time navigation technologies has weakened the relationship
between traffic and urban planning, as planners are no longer the leading influencers on the
nature of   traffic  on  urban   streets. On  the  other  hand,  the  increasing percentage of

3


smartphone users is used to collect bottom-up data on their spatio-temporal movements.
The result is the availability of big data on urban mobility,  which can be used for studying
usage in order to influence urban traffic. We argue that  new planning perceptions should
integrate real-time data and intervene in urban traffic flows not only in long-term plans but
also in real-time interventions. By doing so, planners can join global trends to move to real-time 
decision-making methods and regain influence over the nature of urban  streets and
urban life.
    Here,  we developed a  new  framework  that   is based  on  complex network   theory.
This interdisciplinary field addresses, among others, spatially embedded transportation networks 
that control many  aspects of modern urban life and  thus affect problems such as
traffic  jams,  urban  sprawl, and  epidemiology  (Barthe´lemy, 2011). Many  studies have
focused on the  influence of  street  network  topology  on  traffic  volumes (da  Fontoura
Costa, 2004; Freeman, 1977; Girvan  and  Newman, 2002; Grady  et  al.,  2012; Serrano
et al., 2009). Yet, recent work  (Gao  et al., 2013; Li  et al.,  2015) highlights the fact that
most of the work  on that subject has overlooked the dynamics of the traffic flow  and the
influence it has on the overall urban system.
    A  recent study (Li  et  al. 2015) has introduced  an innovative  approach that  employs
percolation processes in order to identify links that act as significant and repetitive temporal
bottlenecks in urban traffic  networks. The percolation process considers evolving relative
velocities in streets segments, calculates the relative speed on each street segment at a given
time (with respect to its maximum), and uses a speed threshold to define street clusters that
represent functional modules, composed of connected roads with traffic speeds higher than
the threshold. Li et al. (2015) defined the percolation speed threshold based on the maximum
size of the second largest component, examined the resulting clusters, and then focused on
the links that  were identified as bottlenecks. This methodology, which has been tested on
real urban data, not only reveals blocked links but also presents the resulting decomposing
process of the city as spatio-temporal clusters that correspond to different traffic flows at
different time  scales (daily and weekly). This  is based on a  description of  the city  as a
collection of local functional traffic-flow  clusters connected by temporal bottlenecks.
    Exploring  the correlation between the dynamic percolation process of the traffic loads
and the static  street morphology may lead  to meaningful  insights and could be  used in
planning processes and be developed into new planning tools. Thus, the objective of this
work is to unveil the inter-relations between the urban street network and the dynamics of
traffic,  in   order  to  develop  new,  real-time,  decision-making tools  that   can  be  used
by planners.
    We use network percolation analysis, which examines the robustness of the traffic flow-network 
to failure, to identify street clusters that represent functional modules, composed of
connected roads with traffic load lower than a defined threshold. Unlike Li et al. (2015), we
define a fixed speed threshold for the percolation process (as explained in the methodology
section) and focus on the clusters themselves rather than on the links that connect different
clusters. Based on the above, we identify spatially embedded clusters and track their dynamics 
at different temporal scales, ranging from hours to a week. By doing so, we present the
different patterns of urban mobility,  its  evolution, and dynamics, and highlight areas and
times that require the interventions of planners to  improve urban life quality.  Such interventions 
might include traditional planning tools, e.g., changing the land-use mixture; controlling the 
volumes of the built environment; formulating  local business policies; planning
public transportation systems; or even changing infrastructures. However, they should also
include real-time prioritizing tools for  adaptive and dynamic traffic light  systems.

    The  rest  of  this  paper  is as  follows:  first,   we present  the  methodology   we  developed  to
describe the  dynamics  of  urban  traffic   flows  and  the data  sets we  used to  test it.  Then,  we
elaborate  on the  analysis  tools  we developed  in  order  to  evaluate different   spatio-temporal
processes. Finally,  we  present the  results for  our  analysis  and  close with  the  discussion and
the conclusions.


Methodology

We have  developed  an innovative   methodology   to  follow   the  spatio-temporal   dynamics   of
traffic   flows.  For   this,   we  define  two   types  of  clusters:   temporal   clusters  that   represent
the traffic   flows  at  a given  snapshot  in  time,  and  clusters  that  represent  the  change of  the
traffic  flow   over  time.  We analyzed  the  dynamics  of  the  traffic   flows  and  created  spatially
embedded, directed  networks   where the  nodes represent intersections   and the  directed  links
represent road  segments between two  intersections  (where motorized   traffic  is allowed  in  the
examined  direction).   We followed   Li  et  al.  (2015) and  calculated  the  95th  percentile  of  the
maximal  velocity   measure  on  each link   (street)  during   the day.  Then,   we set  its temporal
weight  as the  momentary   relative   speed with  respect  to  its  maximum   value  (Figure   1(a)).
Different   from  Li  et al.,  a link  is defined  as functional   if  its relative  velocity   (defined  here as
traffic  “availability”)     is  higher  than  0.5 which,  based on  the  canonic  Greenshields  equation
(Greenshields   et   al.,   1935),   represents  the   maximum     flow   of   vehicles   (Figure    1(b)).
We defined  clusters  as strongly   connected  components  (using  the  Kosaraju   algorithm;    see
Aho   and  Ullman,    1983)  of  streets  with   availability    higher   than   0.5  (e.g.,  a cluster   is  a
collection   of  streets  where   one  can  drive   from   each  point   to   all  others   without    facing
heavy traffic,   i.e.,  relative  speed <0.5).

nodes represent intersections and links represent street segments. The weight of the links is evolving and

70% of the samples (in this case—over 51 out of the 60 samples). (d) Dark green streets are the cores of
potential DSC, i.e., a set of all overlapping FTCs that contained (at different times) the core streets.
(e) Different DSCs with significant overlapping of their streets (80–85%) are united into a single DSC,
which is used for the analysis (f).

    Clusters that crossed aminimum number of streets were defined as functional temporary
clusters (FTC; Figure 1(c)). Due to the size differences between the cities, we set the minimum to 
100 and 50 links for London  and Tel Aviv,  respectively.
    Next, in order to follow  the dynamics of the traffic flow in specific areas, we developed a
method that integrates spatially overlapping FTCs into a newly developed type of spatio-temporal 
cluster that we called dynamic spatial clusters (DSCs). For this, we defined cores
that represent spatial anchors for FTCs at different times. The core is defined based on the
following stages: (1) we measure, for each link, the percentage of the time it was associated
to any of the FTCs (online supplemental Figure S1), and (2) streets that appeared in 70% or
more of  the  examined hours  in  an  FTC  are  defined as  anchor streets (Figure  1(d)).
This threshold reflects (for the examined cities) anchor streets that represent different neighborhoods. 
Increasing this threshold will  result in fewer DSCs that  correspond to a lower
number of cores, as we explain next. (3) A collection of connected anchor streets is defined
as the core of aDSC. In the next stage, an FTC is assigned to aDSC if the core of the latter
is included (partially or fully) in the former. Consequently, an FTC can be either assigned to
a unique or to different DSCs and thus represent the spatial continuity or discontinuity of
the traffic flow between the different cores at specific times. Aset of FTCs that were assigned
to one core defines a DSC. In other words, a DSC is a collection of  FTCs with  a mutual
spatial anchor (Figure 1(e)). Finally, after all the DSCs are defined, we identified spatially
overlapping DSCs and united them into a single one. In other words, merging the DSCs is a
unification of their FTCs. This iterative process takes every pair of DSCs and analyzes their
overlapping. This process can result in a spatial unification of the DSCs. The overlapping is
based on the number of links in the smaller DSC and  a pre-defined threshold. If the percentage 
of overlapping links  crosses the threshold, the two  DSCs are merged into  one.
The thresholds are based on the characteristics of the area and thus are unique for each
city. We examined different values of this threshold for each city and chose the ones that
yielded, on the one hand, a maximum number of  DSCs and, on  the other hand, merged
spatially adjacent  cores (that  were originally located one  street or  two  streets apart).
Thus, the thresholds for London and Tel Aviv were set as 80% and 85%, correspondingly,
which is also consistent with the findings of Gfeller et al. (2005). We continued this process
until there were no more DSCs that could be merged (Figure 1(f)).
    The above analysis has been performed for two time-frames: the first includes 24 hours
for a seven-day week, and the second includes daytime only (12 hours between 08:00 and
19:00) for the five working  days. The characteristics of traffic flow during  night-time and
weekends were found to be significantly different from its characteristics during the daytime
on weekdays. During night-time, traffic  availability,  as expected, was considerably better
and rather stable in comparison to daytime. The weekend, on the other hand, was charac-
terized by less predictable traffic  behavior in  comparison to  the  weekdays. As we have
collected data for  only  one weekend, we could not  compare the behavior of  the  traffic
flows at these days to the weekdays or to  other weekends. Thus, in this work,  we focus
on the working day’s data set and present only the results yielded from this data set.
    The results of our analysis are presented for two cities: Tel Aviv and London. These cities
represent different types of urban systems in terms of their  size (the sampled area of the
center of London is 2.5 times larger than the area of the center of Tel Aviv) and the transportation 
system within them. While London has an underground, overground, and national rail, 
in addition to a developed bus system, Tel Aviv has only a bus system and a national
rail that operate within its  center. Additionally, London  has a congestion charge (a £11.50
daily charge) for  driving   a vehicle within  the  charging zones (that  are included  in  the
examined area) between 07:00 and 18:00, Monday   to  Friday.  Tel  Aviv,  on  the  other

6

hand, has no such restriction and vehicles move free of charge in the city center throughout
the entire week.
We collected the velocities of road sections in London center and 2950 road sections
in Tel Aviv center. The sampling frequency was 15 minutes over a week time (data for
London were collected between the dates 21–27 March 2018 and the data for Tel Aviv center
were collected between the dates 12–18 February 2017). We used interpolation to calculate
the velocities of additional 9200 and 2450 road sections in London and Tel Aviv,
correspondingly.
Analysis
To explore the spatio-temporal characteristics of the traffic flow, we based our analysis on
different aspects of the DSCs. We start with the estimation of DSC traffic quality (TQ),
continue with the probability of links to be included in the sameDSC at different times, and
conclude with the spatio-temporal stability of the DSC. These attributes were chosen as
they provide a holistic picture of the dynamics of the traffic and highlight planning issues
that need to be addressed (as will be demonstrated in the results section).
Traffic quality
We developed an index to evaluate the TQ and its dynamics, for different streets and areas.
It is based on the assumption that good traffic is represented by a low number of FTCs that
cover large areas, i.e., good traffic flow allows fluent mobility in large areas. Thus, the TQ is
defined based on equation (1)
​

where n represents the number of FTCs at the examined time, P Li represents the sum of the
lengths of the streets in an FTC ranked i, and Ri represents the rank of the FTCs, where
R1 ¼ 1 indicates the largest area and Ri ¼ n the smallest area. Therefore, in the presented
index, units are street lengths (KM) and higher values represent better TQ. The best TQ is
achieved where there is only one FTC that covers the largest area of the surface.
The TQ of the DSCs has been analyzed based on the dynamics of the different DSCs at
different times, as well as based on their rank-size distributions (see online supplemental
Figure S1 for elaboration).
Area-stability: The probability of links to be included in a DSC at different times
In order to evaluate the DSC in terms of their spatial size as well as the stability of the links
they hold at different times, we analyzed the descending cumulative distribution function
(CDF) and its integral. The descending CDF shows the probability of any fraction of links
to appear at least a certain fraction of the time in a DSC (see Figure 4). The integral of the
CDF indicates, for each DSC, both the number of links it contained throughout the entire
week as well as its stability. In other words, the integral of the descending CDF can be used
to evaluate the quality of a DSC in terms of size (represented by the number of streets) and
spatio-temporal stability (the appearance of the same links in the DSC at different times).
Higher spatial-stability values represent a large and stable area, while lower values mean an
unstable area or a stable but small area. The graph that holds the values of these integrals

7


provides an overall perspective of the urban system and allows a comparison between different 
DSCs in a city and between different cities.


Stability

Note that the descending CDF does not separate the stability from the size of the DSC or
indicate the stability at different hours. Thus, we developed an index that offers an indication 
regarding the level of spatio-temporal stability for each DSC and at a given window of
each measured time.
    We followed the dynamics of the spatial structure of the DSCs over time and calculated
their spatial stability  for  each hour during  weekdays only. This is based on the previous
findings that  indicate significant differences between weekdays and weekend in terms of
traffic flow. The spatial stability  (S) is calculated based on equation (2)



where lFTC represents the number of links (street segments) in each of the FTCs included in
the examined DSC at a specific hour, and LDSC represents the total number of links that
appeared at least once in the examined DSC at that hour. m represents the number of days
used for   the  calculation,   which  is  5  in   our   case.  is  at   its  maximum   when
 This indicates that all the FTCs are spatially identical in all the examined days at a specific hour. When 
none of the links  appears more than once in the DSC, and its stability is at its minimum. For our calculation (based on 5 working
days), this  minimum ¼ 0.2; the results  were normalized  to  a  range between 0  and  1.
Unlike other  methods (e.g., the Jaccard index), our method  characterizes, in one simple
number, not only the overlapping that  occurs in all the examined samples (days) but also
takes into account overlapping that occurs between some of the days. By using this method,
we can follow the temporal stability of  the spatial behavior of the traffic flows.


Results

We used the traffic flow averages of each road segment to identify the cores of the DSCs and
found 20 DSCs for London and 9 for Tel Aviv (online supplemental Figure S2a). The DSCs
in the two cities present different characteristics in terms of the dynamics of their stability
and TQ. While some of the variances between the cities could be explained by their different
scales, others are related to other differences between the cities (e.g., the characteristics of
the DSCs).
    The TQ is an indicator for the physical area of the DSCs, which represents the area with
good traffic flow, where high values of TQ correspond to large area coverage (good traffic
flow) of the DSC.We use the standard deviation (r) of theTQ values of the DSCs to present
the variation of their area coverage. Low r corresponds to steady area coverage at different
times while high r indicates large variation in  the TQ.
    While the r  values of the TQ in  Tel Aviv  are similar for  all the DSCs, in London  they
increase for DSCs with high TQ (Figure 3(a) and (b)). This means that the TQ of the DSCs
in Tel  Aviv  is varying similarly  (and significantly) for  all  sizes. In London,  on the other
hand, DSCs that cover small areas are more likely  to remain  small throughout  different
times, and DSCs that cover large areas are more likely to change their size at different hours

8

and days. These values highlight steady and local DSCs in Tel Aviv and more global and
unstable ones in London. Thus, they can be used as a decision-making tool for planners,
since they provide overall insight into the spatial dynamics of the DSC. In addition, this tool
identifies neighborhoods that are well connected to the rest of the city and others that are
constrained in terms of their traffic flow. This also suggests that the dynamics of the DSCs
do not  follow  a universal law  and are location  dependent. This strengthens the need to
integrate bottom-up data that emerges from the local setting in planning processes.
    The dynamics of the TQ over time (Figure  3(c) and (d)) reveals that the maximum TQ
values of the different DSCs ranged from 6365 to 83,185 meters in London and from 26,320
to 112,790 meters in Tel Aviv. The two  cities show a major difference in the dynamics of
their TQ:  in London,  the high  TQ occurs in  the early morning  (08:00) or late afternoon
(after 17:00) while in Tel Aviv, high values of TQ occur at different hours on different days.
This suggests that the dynamics of traffic flow patterns in Tel Aviv are less predictable than
those in London.
    The TQ of  most of the DSCs in London  reaches very high peaks in distinct hours (see
some examples in Figure 3(c)). An example of this behavior is found in the SoHo DSC. In
most hours, it is limited to the western part of SoHo (Figure S2a) and has very low values of
TQ. However, in  the mornings (every day at 08:00), it  is connected to most of the  other
neighborhoods in the north bank of  the River Thames and twice, after 17:00, it was con-
nected to  Mayfair,  Marylebone,  and  Covent Garden.  The  Finsbury  &  Islington  DSC
(Figure 2(a)) is an example of  a different  type of behavior.  The core of the  latter is not
constrained to one neighborhood and it crosses two nearby ones (Finsbury and Islington).
In more than 40% of the time, the streets included in it covered most of Shoreditch, Hoxton,
Clerkenwell, and the eastern part of Barbican. During the rest of the time, it  spans to the
surrounding areas of these neighborhoods and once (on Monday at 17:00), it covered most
of the  streets on the north  bank of  the River  Thames. At  that time,  most of  the DSCs
presented significantly high values of TQ, but unfortunately, we could  not find  any event
that might have caused this irregularity.
    In Tel Aviv,  on the other hand, the change in the TQ of the DSCs is more moderate and
smooth as the TQ of the DSCs varies and reaches high values many times at different hours;
see Figure 3(d). We assume this is because the traffic-flow in Tel Aviv is not constrained by
neighborhoods and thus more regional. The Bavli-Bney-Dan DSC (Figure 2(c)) is a good
example of this, as its core spans from the northeast to the northwest neighborhoods of Tel
Aviv. In more than 40% of the time, it covered parts of four different neighborhoods in the
northern part of  the city and at the rest of the time it  covered most of the examined area.
This DSC is better described as the northern region of the examined area rather than just by
its core (online supplemental Figure S3).
    An exception is Shikun HaKtsinim, which presents low TQ values most of the time, with
several peaks at a few different times; see Figure 3(d). This cannot be explained only by its
size, as Kerem HaTeymanim (Figure 2(d)) is similar to it  in terms of the  number of links
they hold (Figure 4). An explanation for this might be found in its unique morphology: this
clustered area is connected to the rest of the city only 10% of the time, and during the rest of
the hours, it covers a small area and presents very low values of TQ.
    Figure 4(a) and (c) presents some examples of the CDF of different DSCs in London (a)
and Tel Aviv (c). The curve of each DSC provides meaningful insights about its characteristics 
in terms of size and stability. Holborn and Marylebone DSCs, for example, cover, at
their maximum size, 50% and 37% of the measured area, respectively. However, the CDF of
Holborn DSC decreases faster than that of Marylebone DSC. Thus, in 90% of the samples,
Marylebone DSC includes significantly more streets than Holborn  DSC. In  other words,

Figure 2.  Examples of DSCs in London and Tel Aviv. For this analysis we used Head–tail classification (Jiang,
2013; Jiang and Yin, 2014) to visualize the heavy-tailed distribution properties of the data (see online
supplemental Figure S1 for elaboration). The colors represent the frequency of each link included in the
DSC in the entire studied period (12 hours over 5 weekdays): (a) Finsbury & Islington, London, (b) The City
of London, (c) Bavli-Bney Dan, Tel Aviv, and (d) Kerem HaTeymanim, Tel Aviv.


Marylebone   DSC  has better   traffic  flow   as it  includes  more  repeating  streets.  Southwark–
London  Bridge  DSC  is  a small  but  stable one:  a fixed  number  of  streets (that  represents  its
core) appear  in  more  than  90%  of  its  samples.  This  number  is  higher  than  the  number  of
streets that  appeared  repeatedly  in Holborn    DSC  (and  represent its  core)  40%  of  the time.
Figure  4(b) and (d)  presents the values  of the integrals  of  each of the  DSC curves,  multiplied
by the  total  number  of  the  measured streets. Thus,  the  area-stability   values are  represented
by the  total  number  of  links  that  were associated to  a DSC  at  all times,  and  the probability
distributions   of  links  to appear  in  it at  different   fractions  of  times. This  index  highlights   the
differences  between  the  two   cities:  while   most  of   the  DSCs  in   Tel  Aviv   present  similar
characteristics  in  terms  of  their  size and  stability,   London   DSCs  can be  divided  into   three
groups:  DSCs with   high,  average, or  low  values  of size and  stability.   The  DSCs  in the  first
group  are  similar   to  the  DSCs  in  Tel  Aviv   as they  span  beyond  one  neighborhood    on  a
regular  basis. The DSCs  in  the second group   occupy the  area of  one neighborhood   most  of
the time  (40%  or more),  and  the ones in  the last  group  mostly  occupy  only  parts  of a  single
neighborhood.   The  two  DSCs  with   the  lowest  values, Knightsbridge    and  Belgravia,   are  a
good  example  of  the strength   of  the present  tool.   The  area defined  in  this  study  does  not
cover these  entire  neighborhoods   but  splits   them  in  the middle.   The  result  is  a somewhat
broken  traffic-flow    patterns,   which   are revealed  in   the low   values  presented  in  Figure   4.
On the  other  hand,   DSCs,  such as the  City   of  London   (the  historic   business district,   presented 
in Figure  2(b)) or  others in  the South  Bank,  present low  values of area-stability   due to

their  area coverage,  which  covers  the entire  neighborhood    only  less than  20%  of  the time.
During  the  rest of  the time,  the DSC  covers only  part  of  the neighborhood.    In this,  the  City
of London    is very  different   from  Barbican—its    adjacent  neighborhood.    The DSC   with  its
core in  the  Barbican  area  spans north  to  Clerkenwell   and  Islington   more  than  40%  of  the
time. Both   neighborhoods   (City  of  London   and  Barbican)  are  parts of  the  business district
of  London,   but  while   the first   is constrained   in  terms  of  traffic   flow,   the second  is  better
connected to  its  surroundings.   For   planners,  this  information    can  be used in  order  to  prioritize  
different  planning   decisions. Another   example  is the DSCs in  the South  Bank.  In  this
small area, there  are four  different   DSCs  with  their  cores located  in proximity    to each other
(online  supplemental  Figure  S2a). The  area includes  two major   neighborhoods,   South Bank
and Southwark,   where the latter  has three different   DSCs within   its boundaries.  These DSCs
present low  area-stability   values, which  imply   to planners  that  traffic   flow  in this  area needs
improvements.
    From   the stability   index  and the values  of its  DSCs in  London   and Tel  Aviv,  we can  also
see significant   differences   (Table   1).  The   average  stability    for   the  DSCs   in  London    is
 in  comparison   to in  Tel  Aviv.   The  stability    values of  the    in
London   range   from     and   half   of  them   present  average  stability    values  

High  stability    values (0.6  and  higher)   are observed   for  different   DSCs  at  different   hours
throughout   the  examined  period.  Thus,  generally  speaking,  it  can  be said  that  most  of  the
DSCs  in  London   are  stable  in  terms   of  their   spatial  dynamics.   Unlike   the  area-stability
values, the stability   index  presents the stability   of  the DSCs  at specific  hours  while the  area-stability 
values  refer  to   the  spatio-temporal    stability   of   the  DSCs  throughout    the  entire
week. Thus,  five  DSCs  such as Holborn,    Soho,  Shoreditch,  Ferrington,    and  Fitzrovia   present 
average to  high  area-stability   values (Figure   4) but  their  stability   index  values are low.
Looking   at the  other  end  of the  scale, the  DSCs in  the  South  Bank  have low  area-stability
values and  high  stability   index  values.  The  explanation   of  these examples  is  rooted  in  the
fact that  the stability-area   values  consider both  factors  while  the stability   index  concerns the
stability  of  DSCs  regardless  of their   size. Each of  these analyses provides   different  insights
regarding  the  overall   traffic   flow  quality   of  the  DSCs  as well   as the  entire  city.  They   are
needed in  order  to   answer  different   questions,  e.g.,  while  the  area-stability   values  can  be
used to  prioritize    planning   and regulation,    the  stability   index  can  be used  for  local  modifications  
in  tube/bus  frequencies  or  traffic-light    operation.
    In   Tel   Aviv,   on   the  other   hand,   most   of  the   DSCs  show   low   stability   values   that
range   between   0   and   0.35   with    a  few    exceptions   that    are   related   to   two    DSCs:
Shikun   HaKtsinim     and   Kerem    HaTeymanim.     These  DSCs   have   the   lowest   average

characterized               by     unique         morphologies.                 Shikun          HaKtsinim               contains          a    few      parallel          dead-

end     streets        that       are     connected           to     a   perpendicular                street,        which        connects           them       to     the     rest

of    the      city.      Kerem          HaTeymanim,                 which        is    one     of     the     oldest        neighborhoods                 of     Tel      Aviv,

the      high       stability            index         of     these        DSCs         results         from        the       constraints              their        morphology

imposes         on      their       intra-         and      inter-traffic.
       To      summarize,               the      spatial          behavior             of     the       traffic          flow        in      London            is     more        stable

(thus       predictable)               than       that       of     Tel      Aviv        in     terms        of     hourly          behavior.            Tel      Aviv,         on     the

other        hand,        presents          a    more        stable        overall          behavior           in     terms        of      the     similarity             between

the     area-stability                 values        of     its      DSCs.         We      assume         that        this      is     due      to     the      fact       that       the

traffic         flow         in     London            is,      generally            speaking,            constrained               most        of      the      time        to      local

neighborhoods,                   while         the      traffic           flow        in      Tel       Aviv          is     more         regional           than         local.         Tel

Aviv           is       a      relatively               new          city,          built           on        a       North-South                   and          West-East               road

network,           which        can      explain         the     regional           traffic        flow       within          it.    London,            having         developed

organically             for     centuries,           has     a   more       obvious          neighborhood                structure           and      the     intra-traffic

flow       (within          the     neighborhoods)                  is    different            from        the     inter-traffic               flow       between          different

parts       of     the      city.

Summary

We have based our work on the perception that was introduced by H€agerstrand (1970) and
has been widely tested since, that the city is a dynamic entity in term of its spatio-temporal
behavior. We developed an innovative method for the identification of functional dynamic
areas in the city in terms of their traffic flow.  Our method is based on two types of spatio-temporal 
clusters: the first is the FTC,  which represents temporal functional clusters and
contains connected streets that crossed an availability threshold of 0.5. They exist at specific
times and evolve with time. The second type is the DSC, which  integrates spatially over-lapping 
FTCs into  one cluster that represents the change in traffic flows in a specific area
over time. We employed our methods on two data sets for London and for Tel Aviv centers
and analyzed the dynamics of the DSCs based on their spatial size (measured as the sum
of the  street length), and their  spatio-temporal stability.  Our  findings revealed both the
differences between the two cities as well as differences and similarities within each city.
    We demonstrated how the DSC analysis could be used as a comparative tool to study the
spatio-temporal behavior of different cities as well as different areas within a city. The DSC
enables identification (both in real-time and over time) of the boundaries of functional areas
in the  city.  This can  be useful for  developing decision-making support  tools for  urban
planners in their  long-term planning  processes (e.g., land-use distribution, infrastructure
development and alternation,  public  transportation  routes, etc.) as well  as in  real-time
(e.g., adaptive traffic light  systems, and public transportation  frequencies). Additionally,
revealing the dynamics boundaries of the DSCs is significant for planners as these bound-
aries (and the area they hold) affect pedestrians, bike riders, businesses and more.
    “The relation  between micro-economic activity and space, like the relation between culture and space, 
is largely mediated by movement.” (Hillier, 2002)
    Urban and transportation  planning are currently being challenged by real-time navigation apps 
that aim to find the fastest route for their users. The companies that operate these
apps are motivated by their goal to minimize travel time and do not integrate considerations
regarding urban life quality, or public well-being in their algorithms. In  order to be able to
intervene and affect the nature of different urban areas, planners must adopt new tools that
are based on real-time, short-term approaches. These will bridge the  gap between static
long-term urban planning and the flexible and dynamic urban rhythm, and enable planners
to keep their role in the formation of better cities.
