The basic premise of urban\r\nstreets and LOS are discussed. LOS is analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Average travel\r\nspeed (ATS) on street segments is considered as the measure of effectiveness in defining LOS criteria\r\nof an urban street using quantitative methods. The travel speed data collection procedure has been\r\nchanging over time from the traditional followed moving observer method to a distance measuring\r\ninstrument and now global positioning system is being extensively used worldwide. Classifying\r\nurban streets into number of classes and ATSs on street segments into number of LOS categories\r\nare essential components of LOS analysis. Emphasis is put on application of soft computing techniques\r\nsuch as fuzzy set theory, genetic algorithm, neural network, cluster analysis and modeling\r\nand simulation for the LOS analysis of urban streets both quantitatively and qualitatively.\r\nQuality of service of urban streets is analyzed using the satisfaction level that the road user perceived\r\nwhile using the urban road infrastructure. Possibilities are shown regarding the further improvement\r\nin research methodology.

Municipal-level stakeholders involved in landuse\r\nand transportation infrastructure planning consider multiple\r\nsocial, environmental and economic considerations to inform\r\ndecision-making and investments in AT. Evidence around the\r\nfiscal benefits of AT investment for local governments has not\r\nbeen systematically identified. This scoping review sought to\r\nexplore the existing evidence regarding investments in AT and\r\nopportunities for savings on municipal expenditures and revenue\r\ngeneration. In total, 7060 records were located and screened; of\r\nwhich 162 full-text articles were reviewed. Ultimately, 23 articles\r\nmet our inclusion criteria and were included in this review. The\r\navailable evidence focuses on potential economic benefits of AT\r\nin the areas of tax revenues, property values, consumer spending\r\nand employment, all of which are relevant sources of revenue\r\ngeneration in municipal operating budgets. An evidence gap was\r\nidentified regarding AT infrastructure investments and benefits\r\ncorresponding to municipal expenditures (e.g. maintenance cost\r\nsavings). Notably, a large portion of literature was published after\r\n2009, suggesting that municipal-level evidence on the fiscal\r\nbenefits of AT investments may just be emerging.

A literature review was conducted on the state-of-art in the assessment complete street designs. Complete streets assessment requires a context-sensitive approach, thus context-sensitive standards of “completeness” must first be established by combining a street classification system with sets of priorities and target performance levels for the different types of streets. Performance standards should address a street’s fulfilment of the movement, environmental, and place functions, and be flexible enough to account for the many ways that these functions of a street can be fulfilled. Most frameworks reviewed are unsuitable for evaluating complete streets because, with few exceptions, they guide street design by specifying the design elements for inclusion on the street. Secondly, the performance of a street can be assessed according to transportation, environmental, and place criteria, and compared to the target performance levels specified by the street’s classification. As there are many different impacts to consider on a street, additional work is required to define the priorities and performance objectives for different types of streets.
    ## 4 An extensive body of work from the urban planning, health, and\r\nother disciplines has documented the importance of walking to\r\nurban sustainability from health, safety, security, environmental\r\nand other perspectives. These studies come mainly from countries\r\nin North America and Europe, where the majority of the\r\npopulation relies on cars for transportation. Notwithstanding, in\r\nmany countries in the Global South, walking remains a majority\r\ntransport mode, while cars increasingly dominate the urban\r\nstreetscape, but are accessible only to a minority of the\r\npopulation. Chile provides fertile terrain for studying this\r\nphenomenon. This article reviews current practice and recent\r\nresearch of walking in Chile, in light of international findings\r\nregarding walkability, equity and urban sustainability. To elaborate\r\nan overview of the depth and breadth of walking in Chile, an\r\ninterdisciplinary team conducted a literature review, examined\r\nrelevant case study material from experience from Chile and in\r\nparticular from Santiago, and triangulated this mainly qualitative\r\ndata with results from the origin-destination survey applied in\r\nChile’s main cities, Chilean traffic safety data) and results from\r\nofficial transport reports of other Latin American cities [Tirachini,\r\nA. (2019). South America: The challenge of transition. In J. Stanley\r\n& D. Hensher (Eds.), A research agenda for transport policy.\r\nNorthampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing]. Findings show that\r\ndespite priority public investments that have largely prioritised\r\ninfrastructure for cars, walking in Chile has remained as the\r\nmajority transport mode up until today, especially for lowermiddle\r\nincome groups, and particularly for care-related tasks\r\nperformed mainly by women. In this sense, walking in Chile has\r\nproven remarkably persistent. The importance of walking as the\r\nmain transport mode, against the odds, reflects economic,\r\ncultural, and urban form determinants, which are explored in this\r\narticle. Furthermore, a recent upsurge in public interest and\r\ncommunity design initiatives to improve walking, particularly the\r\ngeneration of a Chilean approach to “complete streets” has\r\nemerged, opening up opportunities to challenge Chile’s version of\r\nautomobility in favour of more equitable, active and public\r\ntransportation modes. There is, therefore, in Chile an opportunity\r\nto prioritise the walking mode, improve infrastructure for walkers\r\nand build from preserving current high pedestrian modal shares, rather than having to reverse widespread car use, as occurs in many\r\ncountries in Europe and North America. This potential is highly\r\nrelevant as these conditions are similar to those in other Latin\r\nAmerican cities and, potentially, other cities elsewhere in the\r\nGlobal South.

Various policy frameworks have been created to connect transport\r\nwith development, development with climate change and climate change mitigation with the transport\r\nsector. However, so far no consistent framework exists that addresses these three areas in an integrated\r\nmanner.This article demonstrates that sustainable development of the transport sector is not\r\nviable on the longer term in the absence of such a three-way framework. First, current perspectives\r\nand practices on transport and (sustainable) development are reviewed, demonstrating that outcomes\r\nand policies are not consistently positive on all three dimensions. The article then re-evaluates the\r\nAvoid–Shift–Improve (ASI) approach, initially developed to address climate change mitigation\r\nand other environmental issues in the transport sector, adding two perspectives on sustainable development\r\nthat are not generally taken into account when discussing ASI: transition theory and sustainable\r\nlifestyles. Together with attention to the development function of transport by\r\nincorporating Access into ASI, this could enable a more long-term sustainability-oriented view on\r\ntransport, development and climate mitigation.

Building a community with amenable walk and bicycle\r\nfacilities asks for smart planning and investments. It is critical to investigate the impact of infrastructure\r\nbuilding or expansion on the overall walk and bicycle mode usage prior to making\r\ninvestment choices utilizing public tax money. This research developed a high performance\r\nagent-based model to support investment decisions that allows to assess the impact of changes in\r\nwalk-bike infrastructures at a fine spatial resolution (e.g., block group level). We built the agentbased\r\nmodel (ABM) in Repast-HPC platform and calibrated the model using Simultaneous\r\nPerturbation Stochastic Simulation (SPSA) technique. The ABM utilizes data from a synthetic\r\npopulation simulator that generates agents with corresponding socio-demographic characteristics,\r\nand integrates facility attributes regarding walking and bicycling such as sidewalk width\r\nand total length bike lane into the mode choice decision making process. Moreover, the ABM\r\naccounts for the effect of social interactions among agents who share identical home and work\r\ngeographic locations. Finally, GIS-based maps are developed at block group resolution that allows\r\nexamining the effect of walk-bike infrastructure related investments. The results from New\r\nYork City case study indicate that infrastructure investments such as widening sidewalk and\r\nincreasing bike lane network can positively influence the active transportation mode choices.\r\nAlso, the impact varies with geographic locations–different boroughs of New York City will have\r\ndifferent impacts. Our ABM simulation results also indicate that social promotions foucsing on\r\nactive transportation can positively reinforce the impacts of infrastructure changes.
